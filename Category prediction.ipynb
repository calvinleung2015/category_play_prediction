       "  'text': 'Short Review:\\nA good starting chapter for this series, despite the main character being annoying (for now) and a short length. The story is good and actually gets more interesting. Worth the try.\\nLong Review:\\nBlackwell Legacy is the first on the series of (supposedly) 5 games that talks about the main protagonist, Rosangela Blackwell, as being a so called Medium, and in this first chapter we get to know how her story will start and how she will meet her adventure companion Joey...and really, that\\'s really all for for now and that\\'s not a bad thing, because in a way this game wants to show how hard her new job is, and that she cannot escape her destiny as a medium.\\nMy biggest complain for this chapter, except the short length, it\\'s the main protagonist being a \"bit\" too annoying to be likeable, and most of her dialogues will always be about complaining or just be annoyed. Understandable, sure, but lighten\\' up will ya!?\\nHowever, considering that in the next installments she will be much more likeable and kind of interesting, I\\'d say give it a shot and see if you like it: if you hate this first game, you might like the next, or can always stop here.\\nI recommend it.',\n",

Sonic Generations es el titulo de aniversario del erizo POR DEFINICION mezclando todas las zonas caracteristicas y entrañables de los mejores juegos, brindando viejas piezas musicales remasterizadas y remescladas, pero tampoco creas que son los mismos escenarios, PARA NADA, ya que SEGA se saco un truco de la manga: Classic Sonic, el erizo en su diseño de los dias de gloria... No solo el diseño, TODO lo que amabas de la trilogia del Genesis esta en los niveles de esta version del erizo: plataformeo puro, Por el contrario, el Sonic moderno brinda el significado de la velocidad y la intensidad pura. Eno conclusion: Sonic Genrations es un juego que se necesitaba en la crisis, pero nos abre los ojos para darnos cuenta de la decadencia de Sonic, el juego no es malo... pero se aprovecha de los demas juegos perdiendo una escencia unica, dando a entender que podria ser un tiempo oscuro para el erizo debido a que no ha habido una buena direccion para sus juegos',\n",

The map is huge and allows for a ridiculous amount of exploration, in that you're free to check out a bunch of towns that look the same, small cities that look like the small towns or the single buildings in the middle of nowhere that look like the buildings in the small towns. In my time playing this I've only ever seen one other player, even in full servers. Instead of exchanging glares while we calculated whether or not a fight would be worth it, he punched me once then promptly ran away.\\nBottom line, it's fun if you know what you're doing, boring as hell if you don't. If you get the game, read those guides kids. Of course even then it's still a crapshoot.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'If the devs had the mentality of \"lets make everyone who plays this game experience new levels of hatred\" then and only then would they have accomplished their goals. I fully believe that this game will never live up to the dayz mod due to so many issues with collision, awkward as hell spawn locations, absolutely stupid changes each new update, and just overall slow progress, this game is nearly 3 years old and is still not finished, in my mind that alone is reason enough for this game to not be bought, sadly though i made the mistake of purchasing it when it had first come out and to this day resent that. The game is in every sense of the word broken, guns spawn on the tops of towers and in sheds, but not inside military bases, barracks, or police stations, due to the additions of new guns ammo is now impossible to find making the game no longer true combat between players but rather a guessing game of does he have ammo or not, when the zombies are killed they create a huge empty space around their body in which a player cannot actually move through, something i found out after killing a zombie in a hallway and getting trapped by the invisible wall it created seconds later. The whole idea of item conditions has almost completely ruined any aspects of pvp, making it utterly useless to kill someone unless you can 100% get a headshot on them, otherwise all of their loot is ruined and therefore 100% unusable by any other player. They added in cars that are randomly found broken down and in need of repair but dont actually give any player a chance to fix them due to the fact that tires, parts, gas cans, etc. cannot even be put into the biggest backpack in the game, only carried in a players hands, meaning that to repair a car a player would need to spend hours of their time collecting 1 part at a time and running back to fix it. Characters also cannot hold an extra gun in any backpack, a major inconvienance coming from the mod. Every player also instantly becomes gifted with the blessing of lightspeed metabolism, making them hungry every 10 minutes and only full after eating 23 full cans of beans or 20 or so drinks just to get to a point in which they will not die from hunger or thirst. If a player was to get knocked unconcious in the game, dont bother trying to save them, there isnt any way to recover, as soon as a player gets knocked unconcious they just die after awhile despite any attempts to save them, epi pens, cpr, saline bags do absolutely nothing to help this either. Did you also know that you could get killed from rain? cool right, if you stand in rain for too long all of your clothes become damp and give you hypothermia, sickness, etc. which pretty much kills you if you dont have the right items to combat it, and if your clothes become wet there is no way to dry them off, ever, unless you are to build a campfire and wait around it for some time. In its current state i rate this game 3/10 its garbage and fails in every way to live up to its name, i hope that in the future it will finally work right and not be absolutely stupid, but seeing as the only progress made since december of 2013 was the addition of new guns and useless buildings we may not see any positive changes until 2020',\n",

       "  'text': \"I'm a big fan; I often look for Early Access titles that seem promising and support them, unlike most I realise that most EA titles, you're in it for the long haul if you want anything substantial. Luckily for my timing though, this game already has a lot to play around with and enjoy! To see the game at it's current state and know that more features are on the way is very re-assuring for an EA title.\\nSo far the bugs have been pretty easy to deal with and with a little experience, easier to avoid the second time around.\\nStonehearth will generate a map for you then allow you to pick a starting point on the map, with three relevant resources markers indicating the abundance of trees, wildlife and minerals that you'll need in order to survive. Once you've chosen your spot, you'll have seven citizens, each with different traits that affect how they act in the world usually in a minor way.\\nYou assign jobs to your citizens and from there, it's up to you to manage a good balance of food, town worth and military all while trying to keep your citizens happy. The game has a 'Journal' feature that lets you look at the gripes and praises of your citizens for a given day, helping you to figure out the path to keeping your town happy as well as helping you keep a decent RP mind set if that's your thing.\\nIf I'm honest, I wasn't expecting much after reading the reviews of some other players, but it seems most of them just don't quite get the concept of Early Access or indie game development (you know the ones, on every EA game after a few months or years, complaining that a smalll team reliant on early access and their own money can't make a game as fast as a major studio with a massive staff of experienced full timers). I was shockingly and happily surprised by this game and cannot wait for mods to become more common place. If you like town builders with lots of customization, resource management sim type games, then this is differently worth a peak.\\nI'll update this review as the development progresses, as it stands if they just polished out the bugs and released it the game would still be worth my time, but my review would be much less favourable. Reading about their ideas and plans, and seeing what they have already, definitely gives me hope that these people are serious about this game and to be honest, I cannot wait to see more.\",\n",

In combat, soldiers move and shoot according to a system based on time units identical (?) to the original; so the combat is pretty much like you would expect, except there is a directional cover system implemented, oh, and suppression. Air combat is no longer 1v1 and now you can directly control your aircraft, a mini game that can become tedious with time, but a welcome change nevertheless. I prefer the art style of old X-Com, Xenonauts looks a bit ugly to me. I didn’t play this game a lot but from what I saw the game has its own take on a lot of little things. One thing that stood out and I liked is the introduction of shields. I think the game is OK but I wasn’t impressed with anything, and in the end I just didn’t find it exciting to play.\\nRating: XENONAUTS-COM\\nRecommendation: The game is not bad but there are similar games that are a better option if you are a fan of the genre.',\n",

       "  'text': \"For me, this game is the best the Elder Scrolls has to offer. Sure Skyrim has more smooth combat, animation and graphics. But despite all of that Oblivion has something greater, variety.\\nTo start off on this point, Oblivion has a whole mess of enemies to face from Imps to Ogres, fulfilling a more high fantasy feel than Skyrim. I have taken time out of my own day to essentially list up the amount of actual different enemies. Meaning entirely different races rather than renames with better equipments with individual models against Skyrim and Oblivion has a vast amount more.\\nNot only in enemies is where Oblivion shines against the low amount of variety versus Fallout 4 or Skyrim, it also shines in the fact that the environments vastly vary. We get the well built, structured and upper class Cheydinhal and then we get the snowy and smaller hut-like houses of Bravil.\\nEven the regular environments and weather seem to be in greater volume than Skyrim. I can tell Bethesda put their hearts into this game, even if the graphics were lacking even for the time, they're not overly bad to the point you couldn't play even today.\\nThe Shivering Isles is the greatest once more of the DLC that Bethesda has released, they attempted to live upto its likes in Nukaworld but failed in my view. This will be the greatest piece that Bethesda has released for quite some time and even if you aren't the biggest fan of Oblivion's main story which outperforms Skyrim's greatly. Then at least this part will provide a good use of your time and will entertain you even more after its completion.\",\n",

Aliens Colonial Marines practically destroyed the reputation of Aliens in Gaming, but this game shows when your in space noone can hear you scream.  The graphics are amazing, its one of the first games that really gets the look right, everything is highly detailed, EVERYTHING!\\nThis game is Sigourney Weaver approved, because its a story that makes sense, unlike Aliens Colonial Marines which was a COD clone in space.  Read more here:\\nThings that kept it from a 10/10\\n-The audio is just as annoying as horror movies in the theater.  At times the game is quiet then with no warning the game will blow your speakers making your ears bleed.  Theres no way to fix this so the dialog audio and the SCREECHING super loud audio are equal.  So you just play missing most of the dialog at times.\\n-Suffers from the same problem as DOOM, no flashlight on any of the guns.... at least when they reboot this or maybe as DLC they can sell a Duct Tape mod like DOOM BFG had.\\n-The Map sucks, probably the worst map ever made.\\n-the biggest reason:  LENS FLARE!  Looks like it was put into the game by an 12 year old making an edgy image using photoshop or adobe premier.  Lens flare isnt created by just lights flashing, look out the window at night at cars or windows they dont create lens flare, that is from the refraction of light through glass.  Without looking through glass or someother translucent substance the only way to see lens flare with the naked eye is if you squint your eyes real hard until they water can humans even remotely see lens flare with the naked eye.  Hollywood been goofing with this too lately ever since it got added to their post production suites, so its kinda meh, but is annoying with no way to turn it off.\\nRating 9/10  Value:  $24.99\\n*Would be higher if it included all the DLC and stuff.

This is a brilliant concept for a game and has great potential, but it's spoiled by the people put in charge of it. It works I suppose, mostly does what it says on the box, but you kind of forget about that part while wondering how they let it out the door like this. The whole thing feels rather cheap and unfinished, all the graphics look pretty childish, the story has no structure, there are little to no instructions/tutorials for the user, and the maps are nothing but  big images with some hitboxes. It's confusing to try to play through because there's no direction usually. As said previously, it plays like a promising alpha of a game, but for some reason the developers thought that this was good enough for final release. I can't really nail down why this game feels quite so cheap, but I imagine that's because everything is the problem. Everything needs some work.\",\n",

I can tell this was something of a passion project, so I don\\'t want to bash the game too hard for its lack of gameplay balance or anything resembling a meaningful story. The gameplay itself is basic shoot \\'em up action with permanent upgrades that carry over between stages. I suppose the main attraction of the game is its \"infinite mode\", which I just found to be infinitely boring. Not to mention that the bosses become way harder, but the game doesn\\'t tell you that. Just stick to playing the regular stages, unless 10 to 15 minute boss battles are your thing. The upgrades were fun and rewarding but I quickly realized there were some blatantly overpowered ones. Your best bet is to save up all the ink you collect and get one of the super late game weapons early on. You will breeze through the rest of the game. Spreading out your upgrades and incrementally upgrading them bit by bit is actually a terrible idea. Overall not recommended since there are so many better shmups you can get for cheaper.',\n",

       "  'text': 'IMHO, this is one of the best and underrated MMOs I\\'ve player on my entire gaming life (20 years of gaming so far).\\nWhy, you might ask me? I\\'ll tell ya.\\nThe background story is amazing and it mixes Fallout series, Mad Max movies and also A Boy and His Dog references (if you ever saw this movie, you, sir, consider yourself lucky). The game has an unique atmosphere aswell. Not only a futurist set, but a post-apocalyptic one, finely made.\\nThe map is HUGE, I mean, HUGE (already tell ya that♥♥♥♥♥♥is huge?!). You could spent like 8-10 hours to cross the sectors on foot, if you make it alive.\\nForget everything else about other\\'s game crafting. This is THE♥♥♥♥♥♥\\nYou can craft your own vehicles or train your own animals! Ride a mutant chicken or a horse (you can have many, many different kind of horses) or go in a bad♥♥♥♥♥mode on a bike.\\nYou can craft almost everything, even tents, campsites and stuff like that to get temporary area buffs.\\nCraft armors, firearms, melee weapon, explosives, medicine, steroids, recipes, foods, drinks, mutagenics... the list is so big that probably I\\'d spend all the reviews talking about it.\\nAlso, you need to craft ammunition for your weapons and gas, diesel or biodiesel for your vehicles, besides ration for your animals and repair kits for heal equipment damage from fights.\\nAfter all, even if it bothers some people, I must say that I LOVE the time required to crafting. Everything you make by crafting need proper time to get done, from just a few secs to hours or even weeks. A single tire for a car requires 8-12 hours.\\nIt\\'s a partial FPS where you need to land your blows and aim to shot manually. No auto-target, which is great for PvP. Headshots cause a lot of extra fatal damage, rewarding you for your skill player.\\nThe game have a lot of customization, meaning your character can max various skills to fulfill different roles on a party or even solo. You could be a mutant DPS or a healer, a gunslinger, a rifleman, sniper, fight with a big axe, two tires, be a sneaking rogue, a buffer/debuffer leader or pretty much anything.\\nAwesome.\\nThe game is partial-PvP. I mean, it\\'s not a full PvP map, but, instead, we have PvP zones. On these zones, players need to fight over rare resources like petroleum! People can build settlements and siege-like stuff aswell.\\nThe game has 6 factions which the player can join. Each one has it\\'s owns charateristics, RP-related and PvP gear. These factions are at war/alliance relationships with each other.\\nThe game also have a lot of player\\'s guilds and alliances and people Pvping over resource nodes and PvP zones.\\n- Not just more of the same. It really brings something NEW and FRESH to MMO players looking for something special.\\n- F2P (doesn\\'t matter to me, but it\\'s nice to try for free if you\\'re not sure about it).\\n- Buy, craft and dye clothes and use them over your regular armor on cosmetic slots. You can even paint and customize your car, bike, etc.\\n- Active, nice and helpful GMs; 24/7 on chat.\\n- A LOT OF DANCE MOVES, including MJ and the awesome Carlton Banks dance (Alfonso to his close friends).\\n- A LOT of creative skills that you don\\'t see everyday.\\n- Welcoming and active community (don\\'t let the Steam numbers fool you, cause the most people playing it are using the non-Steam client).\\n- Deep and beautiful scenarios.\\n- Scary voiceover (turn it off, man).\\n- You have a flashlight.\\n- Immersion feel on every step you take.\\n- Level up takes a long long time, giving you some sense of importance in the world.\\n- Awesome PvP.\\n- You can fight while riding or driving! Man, EVERY SINGLE MMO should have this. Drive fast while unloading a submachinegun clip on a pursuit, why not? Not a Fast & Furious type? You can do the cowboy Texas style aswell and shoot you Colt Anaconda on the horseback.\\n- You can have a dog! (anyone remember Dogmeat from Fallout 2?)\\n- Different paces of walking/driving/riding. You can walk, jog or run and drive/ride at speed as you like. Not so fast, no so slow, the way you want.\\n- One thing I dislike in this game is it\\'s name. Should be called Awesome Earth.\\n- Performance issues on some PCs.\\n- \"Dated\" graphics (I\\'ve player UO for 11 years, ask me if I give a dame for graphics?!)\\n- \"Hardcore\", even not having a full loot system like Darkfall, Ultima Online and Mortal Online (love them all). What makes this game \"hardcore\" for some users is the fact that you need build and plan your character very carefully or it could be useless or disapointing at some point.\\n- Unfriendly interface and learning curve.',\n",

The game seems to not want to communicate very well, with scant notifications or pop-up messages telling you whats afoot in your empire. The diplomacy is pretty light, though not the worst in the world. But for a game about ship combat, there's a surprisingly small amount of control, as aluded to earlier, you get no notifications when your ships are in combat, nor can you zoom to your ships or padlock ther camera on a ship (only your flagship and any ship you manually take control of) which makes the game seem incomplete. So many features seem unfinished or rushed and there's no word from the DEV on fixes or further development. The game looks exactly like Distant Worlds and attempts to play very similar but is a far inferior product and I'd reccomend that game over this any day, on account of it being a complete and enjoyable product, unlike StarDrive.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"When The Beginner’s Guide came out last year, I was intrigued by it. The trailer for it was odd and the connection to The Stanley Parable was intriguing. So, I gave it a go recently and I’ve got some thoughts about it.\\nTBG is a first person narrative video game in a genre that’s often described as a walking simulator. It’s about a player experiencing the narrative the developer wishes to share with minimal interactions. In this case, it’s mostly pressing switches, responding to a very basic conversation system and looking/walking around. It’s a pretty passive experience for an hour and half but there’s enough to keep the player invested.\\nThe Beginner’s Guide’s narrative is about Davey Wreden showing off the many small games of an unknown developer called Coda.\\nbut I did wonder for a second in the initial opening. I mean, it wouldn’t be the first time that indie creators came together on a game. But alas, this is a fictional tale. Davey is doing all of this because Coda quit developing games a while ago. So, Davey is showing the Internet these games and his perspectives about them in a bid to get Coda developing again. As Davey narrates, he talks about how he sees Coda through these small little games. That he thinks they give him an insight to who and what Coda is. However, as the game goes along, I start to get a disturbing sense of where this might be going. This was confirmed at a certain point. Davey talks about how he shared these once private works with others because he thought Coda was depressed and needed help to keep going. That Coda needed validation to pick them up again. As someone who is an introvert, I had a feeling that he had gone too far. Coda confirms my suspicions by breaking all contact with him after giving him a final game to play. In it, Coda states very clearly that Davey has a problem, a need to validate himself through Coda’s works and that Davey had taken things way too far by sharing it with others. That he is under the mistaken impression that he knows Coda through his games. Even worse, he had told others that Coda was depressed because of what he interpreted from a couple of games and had changed them through his own edits because he was unhappy with how the games played out. Even though it was distorting Coda’s work. However, it was a problem Davey must work through, not Coda. While all the time, Davey has been changing the work to suit himself and perhaps shows his own failings while doing so.\\nUpon finishing the game, I had quite a bit to ponder over. About my role in sharing other individuals’ work and how I review videogames. That maybe I do this entirely for my own selfish reasons of needing validation. Maybe a small part of me does, but it’s not the guiding force. However, I do think the more cynical interpretation that I’ve seen from others, of what is presented in TBG, is perhaps missing the point it's trying to make. It’s hard to say for certain, of course, but I do think the developer is trying to get the point across….see, it really is that easy to trip up and make the same mistakes Davey makes in the game. I think that this is a game best left up to your interpretation. What the dev may or may not have intended is for him to know. What I can say that I got from TBG is a cautionary tale. That pretending to know someone just based off of their works is dangerous. However, if the point trying to be made is a cynical one about reviewers and how they harm devs or profit off of them, I have one thing to say to that. That I’m in this to share videogames that are worth experiencing I am merely here to talk about and critique what I see as both good and bad ideas in said title. I like to think that what I’m doing is more of a net positive for the developer than myself. But, that’s how I view things. I’m sure some would disagree.\\nRunning off of the Source engine, TBG has all of the expected video, audio and miscellaneous settings that are usually included. Honestly, this game is so short that it’s not really worth listing them all out for you. But if you’ve run a source game like Portal 2 before, then that’s what you can expect to find here. It has good performance and isn’t that demanding to run. I didn’t experience any bugs or issues to report.\\nSumming everything up, The Beginner’s Guide had given me something to ponder. This collection of short games narrated by a man who may have obsession and personal issues to work through is a different experience. It may be a little bit more cynical of reviewers if one particular interpretation of events holds true or it may just be a disturbing look into Davey’s mentality and personality. Either way, it’s a game that requires a pause to consider the implications of not just other’s actions but our own. And perhaps, that we shouldn’t so quickly judge that we know someone based on their works. The game runs well for it’s 1.5 hour runtime and is really only worth playing the one time. But what an thought provoking time that one playthrough is.\",\n",

       "  'text': \", for all its quirks. That is, you're more interested in an interactive story where your choices are mostly reflected in dialogue, rather than changing major plot points. Where the outcome is largely the same but the details along the way become your own - a customized telling, so to speak. If that style isn't your thing, then this won't be either.\\nThis might well be the most successful transition of another intellectual property to Telltale game I've played. The Borderlands series seems at first like a really odd choice for a story-based game, given it has always been about shooting guns and then looting better guns. But beneath the violence and over-the-top style of humour, the games have always had heart.\\nSo it's in this bizarre setting that two non-action heroes can really shine. The game's world is utterly insane, but everyone knows it and they just try to roll with it.\\nSure, it's a horrible death world where masked psychopaths regularly have murder for breakfast, but it's still a world where people have family, friends, and dreams. It's cartoonish but never consequence-free, and though death is practically the wallpaper, it's still something to be afraid of and sometimes mourned.\\nThe writing is enjoyable and mostly maintains a good balance between silliness and seriousness. Moments of drama are interrupted by someone's awkward phrasing, or a surprisingly easy solution to the problem. Characters maybe are a little too self-aware, frequently commenting on their own actions even as they do them, but there are\\nthat hit the mark along with oodles of physical humour. I laughed out loud more than once.\\n. Instead of the usual set of grizzled mercenaries spouting one-liners, the dual protagonists are a corporate jerk and a devious con-woman. You alternate between controlling each of them, and their adversarial relationship turned begrudging respect is consistently fun to play around with. They're not action heroes, but you're frequently plunged into situations the heroes of the main games would have shrugged off with barely a sweat, and so you're left to see how normal people would deal with it.\\nThere are plenty of gems in the supporting cast as well. Some faces are familiar, but for the most part it doesn't rely too heavily on returning characters. They're mostly cameos, temporary allies, or even opposition along the way, but they're never the main focus. The cast is brought to life by\\nby some of the best talents in the business, though the typically clunky facial animation can take away from that a little.\\nAlso of note, as ever with the series, the creators have\\n, making for some awesome musical action sequences to introduce the episodes. I have at this point frequently had to admit I found certain bands I like through the Borderlands games.\\nThere was just a whole lot I liked about this particular story. From its pacing, to its characters, to its consistent tone. I would say there are a few narrative missteps that I won't get into here, but my final feelings are thoroughly positive.\\nbefore playing this. Major plot points from that are glossed over without further explanation, so it would be best to know them. It draws from the Pre-Sequel as well, but not as heavily.\\nOverall, if you enjoy the setting, and want to know what comes next, this is a great way to enjoy the universe from another perspective and in another style.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Zagreviews\\n-Magic Duels\\nSo, I\\'ve been playing this for a while now. I\\'ve been a fan of M:tG for years, so there are going to be a few different points I\\'ll be covering in this little review, coming from both a game play stand point, to how the game is transferred from physical cards, to a digital version.\\nSo to start off, the gameplay is a little tricky at times. Especially for people who are new to Magic.\\nThe tutorial, which grants you gold to purchase cards with at a later point, seems to cover as much as it can, but at the same time, it is a little monotonous. I\\'ve never encountered a game before where I had to click \"Do not show this again\" when tips popped up on the screen. I suppose I\\'m used to games where once a tip shows up, and you click out of it, you don\\'t have to concern yourself with it popping back up every time an event occurs.\\nOther than the slight issue with the tips, the gameplay is fairly well explained, from receiving your first hand, using mulligans, to laying lands, playing creatures, going over creature abilities, how to use them, and even going so far as to guiding you in regards to a red arrow that pops up over cards that the game suggests you should play.\\nThe downfall however, is unless you\\'re playing Versus mode against another player, the game continues to try and baby you through the campaign. Cards you have in your hand, often have that red arrow over them as the game is trying to get you to play them.\\nCampaigns to me, especially in a competitive card game, are generally ways to get you more familiar with different card types, colors, strategies and the like. But with this \\'suggested card\\' arrow popping up, it really feels like there\\'s little to no freedom. Of course, you can ignore the arrow and play your own cards, but there\\'s just something nagging in the back of your mind, wondering if something is going to go wrong because you didn\\'t play a suggested card.\\nIt seemed a little uncertain to me, playing throught he campaign, as to if the enemy AI was scripted to react to said cards or not.\\nOnce the campaigns are completed, you have a nice little chunk of gold to purchase your first starter pack with, and that\\'s something that I do enjoy about this game, is the ability to play without paying. Of course this is your stereotypical \\'pay-to-win\\' game where you can drop a bunch of money into it, and attain all kinds of cards. But if you\\'re willing to work for it, it can be quite rewarding.\\nMy only issue with it being that in order to get money, you have to win against someone in a random versus match, and that the winner only receives 30 gold, and the loser receives nothing.\\nThis is very demotivating. Especially if someone can\\'t afford to pay for cards.\\nImagine this :\\nYou finished the tutorial, finally. You go to the store, get your starter pack, and open up some decent cards. With these cards, and the starter cards you unlocked from the tutorial, you decide to go and build yourself a sweet little deck.\\nOnce satisfied, you head into Versus mode with your head held high with determination and confidence in your deck and your knowledge in playing this game.\\nYou get your♥♥♥♥♥♥stomped.\\nOkay. Maybe that was a fluke. You can\\'t win them all, right?\\nNext game. Wait. What kind of card is that? How come I don\\'t have any of these awesome cards that this person has? Okay, well I guess I just have to endure it and keep playing.\\nTwenty matches in, you\\'ve lost 16 matches, and won 4. For all of your playing, you\\'ve accumulated 120 gold. Not even enough to buy a single booster pack, which totals in at 150 gold.\\nI think that a person should get at least a minimum amound of gold, even for losing. That way, at least with all the losses, you can still afford to update your deck every once in a blue moon. But with the way they have things laid out, (And of course I understand, they need to make a profit off of this game somehow) it just seems that  the game punishes you for doing poorly, and barely rewards you for a win. Why not make a limit to how much gold you can get a day from Versus? Maybe a 300 daily gold limit for wins and losses combined? Maybe it\\'s 50 gold for a win, and 5 for a loss. It\\'s not a lot, but at least it\\'s something, and you\\'ll have more people motivated to play the game in order to get better when they can\\'t slap their wallet on the screen just to get more cards.\\nI don\\'t know, that\\'s just me I guess.\\nThe earning system is really the biggest issue to me in this game. It\\'s a struggle to preservere when you don\\'t have good cards like people you\\'re put up against. Of course there\\'s a lot of strategy to playing said cards, but at the same time, not everyone is going to understand that when they first pick up this game if they\\'re new to Magic.\\nThe game itself, the story line in the campaigns, the characters, the deck customization, the box customization, the play itself, are great. I\\'m horribly addicted to this game, even though I\\'m one of those guys who can\\'t afford to throw money at my monitor.  This is, in my opinion, a great Magic game.\\nThings I might change however, would certainly be the earning system.\\nI am hoping that they come out with more updates/expansions for this. The fact that there is a limited amount of cards means that there\\'s going to be limited amount of things to work towards. Sure the game play is fun and all, but building a collection is also part of the fun.\\nIf you\\'ve made it to this part of my rather winded review, then I sincerely thank you for your attention. If you are into magic, give this game a try. It\\'s a little dodgy getting into it, and understanding how the interface works, but after the tutorial, you\\'ll be making people rage with blue control decks, or red speed decks, or grave digger black decks.\\nThanks for your time.\\n-Zagru',\n",

       "  'text': 'I have played and followed this game for a long time, but I cannot recommend it for several reasons. First of all, the PC version is unplayable at current. This is not a single-player game. Unless you want to do the trials (which I spent most of my time doing), you won\\'t have fun offline. To really experience this game, you need to play against human opponents. The online on PC is extremely laggy and inconsistent and slow in terms of the matchmaking process. But the other reasons I wouldn\\'t recommend it are as follows:\\nToo dependent on match-up knowledge. You can\\'t counter-pick, which forces you to learn ONE character and learn them well. Unfortunately, this is easier said than done. After having cleared all trials and experimenting with every character I still haven\\'t found one that works for me. Whether I win or lose seems to be decided mostly at the character select screen. My performance is not representative of my skill level due to the character I have chosen vs the character my opponent has chosen.\\nNo opportunity to use combos. This might sound like a noob thing to say but despite having excellent execution when in training mode I can never combo anything online not because I can\\'t make the links, but because the opportunity to use it is rarely there. The risk vs reward makes it difficult to justify at times. This combined with the non-existent juggling mechanics mean you have to rely on bread-and-butter combos. This makes the game far too \"flow-charty\".\\nToo much poking. Everything in this game feels safe and hard to punish.\\nAnd finally, the most important one: NO TUTORIAL. This game is about as accessible as twister is for wheelchair users. There\\'s nothing in the game to help you. Altthough the strategy and fundamentals might be intuitive, the controls and mechanics take a lot of practice and aren\\'t actually all that satisfying. The game requires frame-perfect timing and is infuriating if you don\\'t have the patience.\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, this is by far my most played game and I\\'ve had some great moments on it, but to me it\\'s more fun to watch others play it (e.g. Excellent Adventures). As a spectator game, it\\'s often more exciting. But to play? It\\'s more furstrating than rewarding.',\n",

       "  'text': \"The best Star Wars strategy game you will find. Galactic conquest mode is great, allowing for battles across land and space of 50+ planets as any of the game's three factions. Bonuses gained while occupying planets diversify it quite a bit and sometimes makes you want to keep the planet rather than blow it up with the Death Star. Don't look for great depth in this game. You have money that is given on a regular interval, which is determined by planets controlled and mining facilities built on them. Use this money To build units or buildings. Diversify units to counter enemy units well.Conquer the galaxy.\\nThe space battles are amazing and what really make this game great. Being able to target specific functions on larger ships (smaller ones like a Nebulon B Frigate, up to a Star Destroyer or Mon Calamari Cruiser, even to a Super Star Destroyer) serves great purpose. The ability to send bombers in to take down shields with proton torpedoes, for example, is a great use of this as it disables the shields on the ships and makes them vulnerable to laser fire. Units  are well balanced, Empire may get the Executor or Death Star to conquer space and destroy planets, but Rebels get Garm Bel Iblis who can sneak past fleets and invade the ground with his powerful shielded tank- capable of winning over many planet systems.\\nOverall, a great game. I mostly played this as a child when I had it on CD and played a ton, but I do not regret buying this again. However, if you are looking simply for a RTS there are better ones out there (Age of Empires 2, for example). Get this for the impressive Star Wars universe.\",\n",

As Amanita\\'s first full-length game, it has its flaws - Save-game issues, originally had no achievements, now it has achievements but they don\\'t unlock. Slow, unskippable walking animations. The seemingly unescapable \"click the exact pixel\" puzzles. In spite of all that, Machinarium has undeniable charm and style. Beautiful art, one of my favourite video game soundtracks. Clever puzzles to accompany a gorgeous game. I think everyone should finish Machinarium at least once, which is saying something considering how many flaws I was able to list.\\nFor what Machinarium does right, it excels at.\\n8.5/10',\n",

       "  'text': \"This game was one recommened by Extra Credits on Youtube, they are really cool guys that disect games. I would love to call them a game critic/educator.One thing they always say when they recommend a game is not that it's good but it does what it claims well.\\nNow they recommend this game on the cool gimmick of you can takover any ship you see and use it's cool ability. That's really freaking cool and fun. Got to try them all out. Shield flying guy was my favorite.\\nProblem is the game is boring when you have to play through 9 levels which are about 2 mins each, but most of them are boring. To me they feel like filler, which is funny thinking 2 mins of a level is too long. But multiply that by 50 levels and that's alot of not fun happening. The best think about this game besides the ship swapping is the extra mode: Boss rush which takes most of the boring levels and takes you to the challenging boss fights one after another which is quick and a blast.\\nLevel 7 boss is so hard for me.\\nOk so how do i rate this. Should you get it or should you not. Well it's fun but only for about an hour which is what i got out of it. Not for $10, but for $1 included with 3 other games(Payed $15 on bundle, got like 10 games, Hand of Fate was one and Ether One were the 2 big games included). Now that's not too bad. I wish there was a middle ground, like a thumbs sideways if your not sure.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"First I was a bit hesitant reading some bad reviews, but then I downloaded the demo and played 1 hour straight to the end it. The moment it got cheaper (50 %) I bought it and have to admit that I got excellent fast-arcade-first-person-shooter-experience. If you have 3d vision you should definitely try the game as it looks excellent and immerses you straight ahead (make sure using helix-fix). I understand the critics that the level design is somewhat linear and may get boring after a while, but overall I would say for 7 hours first play through I never felt annoyed by the same kind of levels, actually I had fun until the end and the bosses are epic, are huge and afford a little bit effort in tactics - not a lot so that you won't get bothered fast. I would love to say sth to the Multiplayer, but it is not possible for the reason that no one plays it. Overall I'll give it a 7/10 which is very high on my scale. Check it definitely out if you play 3d vision. If you don't, you should get it when it's cheap. It still has a great design, great gunfights, great achievement system, and much fun!\",\n",

Extremely long queue times, and the only map I ever seem to get is some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Super Mario map.  The movement is slow as hell and wonky, which is weird because I played it several months ago and it was smooth.  Although, maybe it's something with that terrible Mario map that slows down the movement?  I don't know because I never get loaded up into another map.  The only time I did was at the end of the match and I loaded into a safe room or something and was stuck in place, couldn't move, couldn't spectate, I was just stuck there.  I apparently can't get loaded into a game that is unranked, as it always tells me there are no matches available.  I know this isn't so much the probelm of the developer and more that what players are logging in play those modes, but if there was a larger player base it wouldn't be an issue.  I was really hoping KF2 would be KF1 with updated graphics and some new gameplay additions, but it fell disgustingly short on all of those aspects.

The ending of this one kinda sucks and the story isn't very good aswell as character developlment is pretty lackluster.\\nBut if you'r like me and you want to focus on gameplay this is better than the first primarily because its much less frustrating. You won't get stuck being stunned and knocked around and the combat is alot smoother but theres even less variety of enemies it feels like. Neither of these games really do anything new besides physics stuff, which is alot less a focus in the 2nd game, but both games are still enjoyable with all their faults. The only gameplay thing that really annoyed me is the focus on alot of  QTEs to defeat enemies aswell as the final bossfight which is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and isn't very well setup as I fell during or after cinemeatics without any real thing I could have done.\\nWhat is good is that its a relatively short and simple hack and slash game without to much junk but that is also its downfall.  Its an okay game but nothing worth rushing out and buying new, I pity the people that bought this game for $60 and the first probably wasn't worth that either even though it is a slightly bigger game.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"One of the best RTS 4X strategy games out there.\\nThis game is about pure survival, you will try to use whatever tool necessary to make sure your empire sees another day.\\nIt offers the four mighty Xs, Exploring the darkest corners of the solar systems or entire sectors. Expanding your empire by colonizing all kinds of different planets, asteroids and stations. Gathering basic resources which you need for your empire's growth and most importantly eliminating rival opponents in both single or multiplayer matches.\\nOne of the greatest features of this game is actually the option to zoom in onto even the smallest objects in the space. Therefore you can enjoy some really beautiful sights of awesome ship and building models and space battles.\\nYou can take control over large amount of ships which you can even asign into custom fleets to ease issuing commands.\\nThe game's soundtracks are one of the best I've listened to while playing any kind of strategy games, simply marvelous.\\nBoth single player and multiplayer gameplay is really smooth and solid. All the base game races are surprisingly well balanced. Every race has its pros and cons, but they share a kind of a basic setup from where the different specializations start off. What really surprised me about this game is that you can actually host a multiplayer match on a public IP with an access to your router's port-forwarding rather than crating LAN or Official lobbies.\\nThere are few things that actually dissapoint me about this game.\\nOne of them is the lack of any sort of story based missions or a campaign, which is really a shame, because the littly backstory of this game is really interesting and is surely worth pointing out.\\nThe other, but not the last thing is about the not very efficient AI difficulty levels.\\nUsing increased income bonuses and faster research as a buff for higher difficulty AI is in my opinion wrong move and it is nearly impossible to defeat highest difficulty AI in a regular match just on your own, without anyone else to balance the enormous pressure on, because the enemy's economy overcomes you in just few minutes into the game.\\nOther great thing worth pointing out is the support for mods. There are plenty of awesome mods out there, which can really spice up the gameplay of the base game or add an entire new experience with something new, using conversions.\\nAs of the DLCs, If you find yourself enjoying this game at first, and you kinda get into it I certainly recommend adding both of them into your game as each of them adds some minor things and tweaks that can really improve the overall gameplay experience of every match you play.\\nI've played this game for more than a thousand hours in total off-steam and I enjoy every battle I manage to win or lose decisively or just by a pure luck. SoaSER is love, SoaSER is life.\\nWithout anything more to say, I would rate this game by 9/10 for how awesome it is.\",\n",

That\\'s the basic description of the gameplay, but there\\'s a deeper story involving children who are endlessly amusing them by constantly buying junk to burn in their \"Little Inferno Fireplace\". From what I read on the web, the game is a satire of casual gaming and while I see hints of that in some of the items you buy, it didn\\'t seem blatant that it was making fun of microtransaction gameplay (other than making you buy items, but at least those items will give you more money than what you paid, instead of arbitrary time to spend in a game), so I think the joke falls short. There\\'s a deeper message to be found through your communication with a neighbor who is also \"playing the game\" and what happens to her once she burns her house down due to playing too much.\\nYou start with a fireplace, a catalogue, a small inventory. You start out buy burning toe terms of service and end user\\'s license agreement which results in a little money to order from the catalogue. All items can be burned for money that results in a profit. The orders are delivered to you over a set time frame and once recieved, can be opened and thrown in to the fireplace in which you can burn them with left click (your only control). The most amusing part is just burning various items and seeing how they react to each other and what item combos are named after burning related items - which give you stamps to have items delivered to you faster. This does however, make me wish an indie dev would make a similar, higher fidelity game that would take advantage of better PC system specs and a modding community.\\nI had fun with this game, including being able to burn photos from my network of friends on Facebook, and the humorous tone of the items delivered and the overall experience of the game - not to mention the game does a great job burning items in a beautiful display of fire. I was able to finish this game in 4 hours, which is all I needed, though, there is more replayability through an alternate ending and finding all the combos.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Wow, what a great \"good game-bad port\" example. After playing Final Fantasy V on Steam (and enjoying it), i guessed that Final Fantasy VI would be an equal or greater port. But i hate to say that i was wrong. This port is terrible. Sure, it\\'s completely playable to 100%, but it\\'s ugly to look at the entire time. The sprites and backgrounds are pixelated and incohesive. The interface sucks. The diagonal movement here is terrible, even with a controller. Likewise, inputing Sabin Blitz commands is terrible because of the diagonals poor sensitivity. I recommend you playing it in windowed mode with a controller, it helps a little bit.\\nBut make no mistake, the game itself is great, one of the best JRPG\\'s that i played in my life. There\\'s a great story with a great twist in the middle, great characters, NPC\\'s and villains, the combat is good, exploration in a airship is fun as always, and the music brilliant, especially the opera compositions. It\\'s the best classic, 2D Final Fantasy hands down and i recommend every fan of the genre to play it, even it you choose another version. This version has achievements, but that\\'s little compensation. Over time, i managed to get somewhat used to this version, even if it doesn\\'t have the same feeling as the other classical versions. If you really want it, grab it on sale. Despite the crappy port, it\\'s compeltely playable, even if it\\'s frustrating at times.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Starseed Pilgrim is a very unique game. Most of the fun comes from experimenting with the different colored blocks and figuring out what everything in the game world means. Nothing is explained when you first start, but the game doesn't penalize you at all and lets you explore the mechanics as you teach yourself how to play and develop your own strategies for succeeding. In the simplest explanation, you place differently colored blocks to try to get more differently colored blocks and grow your tower while escaping the spreading darkness. Each colored block behaves differently, so the engagement comes from figuring out how to optimize your block placement to get as far as you can.\\nI don't think Starseed Pilgrim will keep you coming back for too long, but it's the kind of unique game you should try for a little while to see what works and what doesn't. I would recommend if you're interested in abstract indie titles or if you're a game designer looking for more unique study material.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I got this game in a bundle, and was unsure whether or not I wanted to keep it. After reading numerous comments and reviews about MKH, I decided to give it a try - and was really happy to get a chance to play through it.\\nIf you enjoy Japanese-themed swordsmanship with challenging technical mechanics, fighting mobs of enemies, and grinding for upgrade systems, then you will really enjoy this game.\\nThe aesthetics are fantastic - the detail in the different character models is very good, and the fighting special effects is well-done. The music and sounds are great, adding a high level of intensity to the brutal, fast-paced gameplay. The cutscenes are short but sweet, and add an anime-like feel to the narrative. Although fairly basic, the story is decent enough to keep you interested in the plot (although the fighting mechanic definitely is the shining gem for this game).\\nThe controls can be challenging to learn - especially if you do not use a controller. The move list and tutorials are helpful, however, the default keybindings make keyboard play unnecessarily difficult. That being said, I completed several playthroughs without a controller (I will be attempting to complete it on the hardest difficulty with a controller, since keyboard play is far too brutal), so it is possible if you have no alternative. The learning curve is moderate to challenging because the later stages (and higher difficulties) really require you to utilize more advanced moves - like countering and parrying. If you cannot do this in the later levels (and/or difficulties), you will not get very far.\\nEach \"level\" consists of multiple waves, followed by a boss fight. Every enemy type follows a particular attack pattern that you can memorize and use to your advantage, adjusting your playstyle accordingly. For each kill you make, enemies may drop health or experienc orbs - experience is added to your total pool, which can then be used in the abilities store (you can access this at any time by pressing ESC).\\nThere are a variety of things you can unlock and upgrade - in particular, improving your health and \"katana energy\" gauge (used to perform moves with your sword) is crucial to survival and chaining more combos. Improving your normal attacks will allow you to do more damage, refill more of your energy bar (hand-to-hand attacks refill your energy), and increase attack range, among a multitude of other things. You can also unlock a deadly counterattack, which is essential for defeating higher-tier enemies, and even bosses. Special attacks can also be unlocked and improved, however, it is entirely possible to complete at least one playhrough without further enhancing these things (it will just make it more difficult).\\nFor achievement hunters, it can be both very fun and very lengthy to unlock every achievement in the game.\\nOverall, the game is a lot of fun, and technical players will appreciate the depth of the possible fighting controls and combinations. Definitely give this game a try.\\nRecommend!\\nCheers,\\nDJSF',\n",

       "  'text': 'The story itself is terrifying. I\\'ve studied up on the kholat incident and it truly is unexplainable.  But what the game tries to do fails on every level.\\nSo people will look at my game time and think \"How can you know what the game is like with only half hour of gameplay\".  I\\'ve watched many lp\\'s before puchasing.  I knew what I was getting into.  Watching and playing a game are different experiences.  My experience was very dismal and boring.  How you arrive at Kholat makes no sense early on.  You just get teleported there. Maybe the game explains this later on but i couldnt trudge through the boring gameplay long enough to figure that out.\\n+Good graphics.  Nearly constant 60 fps with a few 48 fps dips here and there.\\n+Sean Bean as the narrator.  He does a competent job.\\n+Good overall voice acting from other actors.\\n-Repetive gameplay. Pick up notes to learn the story and escape from the monster every once in awhile.\\n-Terrible save game feature.  If you die, you have to repeat sometimes several minutes of gameplay.\\n-Character gets exhausted from running literally after 5 SECONDS.\\nI paid only 8 bucks for this game. But these days, I grow weary of just walking around and picking up notes.  This technically could be considered a walking simulator game but there isn\\'t any survivival.  You don\\'t have to maintain water or food levels which I think would\\'ve added something more to the boring gameplay.  At least a cold meter would\\'ve been nice.  You are walking around in a literal blizzard for most of the game.',\n",

       "  'text': 'A definite curiosity, given that every unconventional decision the devs have made (e.g. graphics, music) is \"balanced\" by another decision stubbornly steeped in tradition (e.g. gameplay, sound effects).\\nFirst up, and most notably, the graphics. Equal parts beautiful and bizarre, both the aircraft and scenery were hand-crafted with models, and while this doesn\\'t necessarily make for the most aesthetically flawless game in shoot-\\'em-up history, it does make for one of the more unique-looking ones. There\\'s even roads with moving cars and tracks with moving trains on the ground far below you, and explosions created with the aid of firecrackers! It\\'s all quite charmingly \"Thomas the Tank Engine\"-ish, really (albiet from a bird\\'s-eye point of view, and with a slightly older audience in mind).\\nThen there\\'s the soundtrack, which is comprised entirely of swing-y jazz numbers. In an era full of gamer guys and gals whose idea of musical \"entertainment\" consists primarily of electronic bloops and bleeps, it\\'s a bold decision to say the least. And one which, I\\'m pleased to report, works alarmingly well (even if the two tracks on offer do get old kinda quickly).\\nBut if you think that all sounds a bit \"quaint\", like a video game from the 1930s which of course never quite existed, rest assured that the GAMEPLAY is straight out of an 80s arcade machine. You know the type of top-down shooters where you move up, down, left, right, and just shoot, shoot, shoot (and unleash the occasional screen-decimating bomb, for good measure)? Yup. It\\'s one of those. No twists, no innovations...exactly like the one you used to play in the corner store near your high school during lunch hours (yeah, I\\'m that old). And I wouldn\\'t even say it\\'s one of the BETTER ones of its type, given how repetitive the vertically-scrolling scenery and recycled level design quickly becomes. Oh, and to make things extra-hard, you only get one \"man\" (granted one with quite a bit of health, but once you crash it\\'s GAME OVER, chum).\\nThat said, perhaps the closest game this reminds me of - at least in spirit - is another recent-ish Steam release called Ballpoint Universe. That one did something quite similar with hand-drawn biro artwork and a side-on scrolling POV; but in all fairness, it did also attempt to add a bit of skewed storytelling and psuedo-platforming to an otherwise equally conventional 2D shooter. The end result was a bit on the baffling side at times, though, so The Blue Flamingo does ultimately emerge as the slightly more \"fun\" and \"accessible\" of the two excursions.\\nThis certainly isn\\'t a game which could be recommended for the gameplay alone (unless you\\'re the type who eats shmups for breakfast). But it is cheap, even when NOT on sale, and is certainly worth a look for the plain-old-curious, and even more so for those intrigued by the astonishing visual possibilities for games as we head into infinity and beyond.\\nVerdict: 7.5/10.',\n",

       "  'text': \"A long story-rich RPG game with decent battle mechanics that make you think. Finished the game within a week and that is skipping all the side quests after Chapter 2. It should take longer if a person wanted full completion. The main drive for wanting to play is that right from the beginning you start off with questions, about the main characters past and finding your dad that disappeared's whereabouts. It's the quenching for this curiosity that makes you play until the end. I find that most RPG's it's very hard for a game to hold your attention enough to make you play till the end and this game does this superbly. There are a lot of mysteries and well-built storyline in this series which explains why it is a trilogy.\\nThe characters are likeable and play a crucial part in the plot. Near the end of the story I found myself not sure of who to put in my party because I liked everyone of them and they each have their own strengths. They each have their own motives for acting and are very related to one another which makes it hard to think of them as just another party member that joins for reasons that are unbelievable. They join the party and leave because they have other things to do and the reason is not just the world is in danger so I am going to stay in the party from start to finish.\\nI found the battle system a bit slow for my taste (was fun for me nevertheless), but there are orbments/customisations that allow you to skip battles entirely. Even when skipping there are times when the game lets you farm monsters for levels allowing you to catch up on levels to advance the plot. The battle system is unique as instead of having critical hits there are bonuses on a specific turn and by using crafts/skills or ultimate abilities you can intervene or bypass a turn to prevent the enemy from getting said bonuses. Position is also crucial as if you bunch your characters up you can get hit by aoe attacks but it also makes the enemy come running at you in a cone so you can hit your aoe attacks more easily; also you can choose to make position your characters far so that it takes 2 turns to hit you. The game requires customisations to get skills and thus is very flexible with no strict warrior/mage development archetype.\\nThe music is excellent. I never get tired of listening to it - everything including the battle music, the map music, the OST that runs in the backgrounds for dramatic effects and the main character's harmonica song whereabouts of the light.\\nFor difficulty, I first started on nightmare and was a wreck, spent 6 hours in the prologue and gave up, it's near impossible on first playthrough. Hard difficulty seemed like it would take awhile to complete so I started off on normal mode just to know the story.\\nAll in all the game was a good experience and I'm looking forward to playing the sequel. I'll probably aim for 100% completion before that in my next playthrough.  I recommend playing this game if you don't mind the cliche story and/or slow battles.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Chiaroscuro: The Game.\\nOh boy, this game... as I tried to compose this review in my head while playing through this game, every opinion I had caught in my throat. Every feeling of awe at the game\\'s stunning landscapes turned sour as they were constructed around frustrating puzzles, every complaint at the periodically frustrating darkness cut off by the game\\'s fantastic score. It took me to the very end to decide if I would even come out with a recommendation or not.\\nI did.\\nNaissanceE is a exploration/puzzle game with an emphasis on the interplay of light and dark. Well, that\\'s not quite true. Because as a game, it\\'s not particularly good. As a portfolio, on the other hand? It\\'s FANTASTIC. This game\\'s developer should be given their pick of set design jobs for the rest of their career. \"Breathtaking\" is a word not used in much hyperbole here. There were several moments throughout the game where I had to simply stop and admire the amazing views I was offered. I\\'ve played amidst many amazing worlds in games, and I think this might be among some of the most impressive.\\nNaissanceE doesn\\'t have much - if any - story, and while a bit of context might have given a deeper appreciation for what I was looking at, ultimately it didn\\'t need it. The vastness and the detail of the seemingly endless (in every direction possible) cityscape spoke for itself. It felt timeless and haunting, the inevitable disquiet of any location simultaneously vast and empty. The soundtrack helped, with beautifully atmospheric tracks that perfectly suited the mood. I\\'m genuinely disappointed that the soundtrack isn\\'t an available purchase in the store, because this is probably the first time I\\'ve actually wanted to buy it separately.\\nAs I said at the beginning though, the game isn\\'t perfect. Many of the puzzles are franky awful - I must\\'ve toggled noclip on a dozen times after getting sick of the latest segment - and there are a few sudden, jarring tonal shifts that completely lose track of what the game is good at, including one chapter that is essentially one long chiaroscuro acid trip where everything becomes abstract and the music takes on a manic, wacky tone that doesn\\'t at all fit with anything else.\\nWhat ultimately landed a positive review on it after the annoyances balanaced out the game\\'s beauty was the unexpected appearance of a final boss. Without spoiling too much, after spending the entire game essentially alone, the final sequence is a terrifying chase that brings to mind the shoggoth encounter from H.P. Lovecraft\\'s original \"At The Mountains of Madness\" short story. A sudden heart-pounding finale left me in a good mood on the way out, predisposing me to a recommendation.\\nCheck it out, but don\\'t be afraid to cheat to advance. The scenery is what you\\'re here for. NaissanceE might\\'ve worked better as an actual walking simulator or a puzzle-free VR experience, but it\\'s still an absolute treat for the eyes and ears.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Hatred\\nIsometric shooter\\nDestructive Creations\\nDestructive Creations\\nis an isometric shooter developed and published by Destructive Creations, and has become famous due to the violent nature of the game.\\nThe story isn't deep and neither serious, paying homage to multiple exploitation movies of the 80s. You play as the Antagonist, a man who hates humanity and decides to commit mass murder until he dies. The dialogue is mostly said by the Antagonist, and is either painfully dumb or hilariously cheesy. This game is not meant to be taken seriously.\\nUsing the Unreal Engine 4, the game looks good and has great destruction. Unfortunately, the performance is very poor, the environments look bland due to the black-and-white style and the NPCs are not much varied.\\nYou go around and shoot people. The end.\\nAll joking aside, your goal is to go to points of interest and kill everyone that you find in the surprisingly huge levels. You can use three weapons at a time (ranging from pistols to flamethrowers) and three types of grenade as well as gasoline tanks and whatnot scattered around the environment. You can also drive some vehicles, but they usually destroy after a few shots. If a person falls to the ground and doesn't die, you can execute him/her in order to regain health. The animations tend to get repetitive and annoying, but you can disable them in the options. The A.I. isn't even all that smart, with civilians casually strolling by while you are stomping someone's head on the ground.\\nThe concept is repetitive, and if what you have read might keep you entertained, than buy this game. Otherwise it's not for you.\\nThe game is challenging thanks to the high number of police officers. You will mostly likely die because of explosions, getting run over by a car or simply not executing someone. The order difficulties tend to make the make more entertaining, while still not being too frustrating and impossible.\\nMost of the sound effects are fine, but the music isn't all that memorable. The voice acting is cheesy and the music lends itself to the nature of the game, with a hard-rock soundtrack that fits the gameplay but isn't all that great outside of it.\\nA total of 7 levels, 42 achievements, mod support and possible DLC make this a game playable once or twice in its current state. There are some secrets in the areas that you explore, but nothing worthile.\\nMuch ado about nothing. This game will be forgotten in a few months and we will all look back and laugh at how everyone overreacted. The game is a good time-waster, not that different from something like 1997's Postal or going on a mindless rampage in GTA. If you like the genre, you'll have a blast playing this.\\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Final fantasy VII is a classic, a game which deals with a lot of real world issues cleverly by mixing it into the fantasy world. It is a hybrid of fantasy and reality, with an industrialized/modern world meeting beasts and untamed lands. This game is however relatively dated (although some elements stand the test of time), but it is a must for any JRPG fan, as it offers traditional turn based combat, an intuitive magic (materia) system, lots of \"sidequests\", a strong narrative and an open world to explore. This game captivated me when it was first released, and even to this day continues to do so. Final fantasy VII also uses humor throughout the game, and gives you \"options\" with how to handle scenarios in the game, which impact the world, it is therefore a game you will find yourself playing again and again to revisit events and experience other paths (albeit all leads to same game ending). The cast of characters is colorful as well, and they have become iconic in their own rights. This game is designed with the \"traditional\" JRPG elements of the time, something not often seen today, as such it is worth exploring for both fans and the untested alike. Overall this game is a full recommendation, its style may not be for all, but it is a relatively accessible and enjoyable gaming experience and it is priced appropriately, giving you a substantial amount of game (30+ hours easily).',\n",

If you're looking for a Metroidvania, this barely qualifies.\\nWhile the art is phenomenal, and the puzzle platformer elements are decent, the game design is amateur at best, and the handling is often times rather floaty.\\nUltimately what you get is an almost completely linear game with some backtracking just to grab stuff with new abilities, intersparsed with meaningless combat and insufferable chase sequences.\\nAs a game, 7.5/10.  There are many flash games that would give it a run for its money in terms of content, controls, and enjoyment, but the entire package does a lot to show what video games are capable of as a matter of artistic elements, in that category it is superb.  For the money, it's decent value, though it has almost no replayability, but it's probably worth experiencing if you don't mind a 5 hour experience.\\nAs far as anyone complaining about the save system, or this game being hard, they're just bad at platforming.  Took me about 4 hours to beat without ever really getting stuck.\\nThat said, bugs could screw you over.  When I beat the game, Ori softlocked my entire computer.\\nSPOILER\\nAnd a warning to completionists:  After the Air Temple you will lose access to 75% of the area that it is in, and after you enter the Fire Temple there is no going back.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'is a puzzle/exploration game as a collection of quite unconventional happenstances. Even after fully completing the game, I keep contemplating over it. Then, the developer must have achieved what he was striking for: through a series of \"fourth wall breaking\" scenes and situations, this game made me think on a deeper meaning hidden behind the absurd. As mentioned by the creator: \"finding worth in the worthless\".\\nstarts with Anthony going to Sam\\'s party - a girl that he\\'s into as we know. The screen starts to get blurry with music fading on the background. The next thing we know, is that we wake up after a party hard and no one seems to be around. We wander within the mansion and stumble on Vincent, or rather Vinny - who prefers to communicate with us through old radios for some reason. He mocks, insults, and challenges Anthony at every step of his journey, for either finding Sam or getting the hell out of this damned mansion by himself. What will you choose?\\nThe game holds and utilizes all the possibilities of Unity3D, not marvelous, but pretty enough if used correctly. Yet, what the game aims to be is not beautiful anyway. It aims to be frustrating and enlightening at the same time, and it manages to be both. As a side note, you shouldn\\'t really try this if you have epileptic tendency, because you\\'ll be encountering sharp turns of the camera, sudden flashes and changes of light quite often. Even I got dizzy and a bit nauseated from time to time. The game has an unconventional loading system btw; each time you\\'d like to load an episode, you have to type in the name of the episode, so be warned. Attention is your friend sometimes; some other times... you\\'d better gaze elsewhere because you\\'d lose time out of curiosity. Achievements are a bit glitchy, so you should verify local cache from time to time to make sure they\\'d pop up when the requirements are met.\\nWith no subtitles or direct screen commands, you have to listen carefully to understand Vinny, think on it and react as fast as possible. The game keeps both your wits and reflexes sharp. Expect the unexpected. Think outside of the box. Even with the most cliché anecdotes, there is a hidden smart remark, a tongue in cheek mockery with the idea of \"common\". It is brilliant in a way, and peculiarly annoying and meaningless. Even for that paradox only, I\\'d recommend the experience.\\nConsidering it is a free game, there is nothing you\\'d lose for taking a glance. For me, even writing this review has been a challenge, since the whole idea of the game constrains you from declaring general opinions. Try for yourself. What you\\'ll encounter is nothing you\\'ve ever encountered before; that I can promise.\\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller\\'s Curator page\\n- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!',\n",

There's almost no characterization and they seem kind of annoying and whiny most of the 1st episode, hopefully they'll improve, so far the only characters that seem worth liking is Petra and Reuben.

Seeing it for a really low price on the HumbleBundle website, I shrugged and bought it on a whim.  I am proud to say that this game has won me over.\\nThe plot is pretty straightforward.  You're part of an inline skating gang that is trying to win the city of Tokyo-to via tagging.  You have to deal with rival gangs and police.  Sounds pretty simplistic and boring, but I think it's far from that.\\nThe soundtrack is awesome and won me over the minute the first song came on.  The environments, for a game that was first released in 2000, look really nice.  The gameplay itself is really fun, jumping around the environments and evading your enemies whilst trying to completely cover the area in colour, and I also took a liking to the characters almost immediately.\\nThe story is a bit lacking, but to be fair it's really not something that you focus on compared to the ever-so-enjoyable gameplay.  So what are you waiting for?  Get the damn game!!\",\n",

I still find the game fun even if the community does a huge amount of valve's job for them. There may still be people who love the game like me, but valve has to truly care more about the game and be more clear to us on future updates if they want to both keep players and possibly bring some back. I still recommend the game because, in my opinion this game still is great even with the recent mediocre and/or terrible updates. I have looked past it and will continue to look past it since i still have hope in valve. If you are new to the game then try to enjoy it for what it is now, since it can still be a hell of a blast.

Running low on fuel meant that I couldn't cook any food. Running low on fuel meant that I wouldn't be able to keep warm throughout the night. Running low on fuel would be the cause of my death if I did not do anything about it.\\nI had foolishly used up the majority of my fuel and wood beforehand, not preparing for the harshness of winter. Everyone on the streets of Sarajevo valued those two items more than gold itself - and rightly so. Being able to keep warm means not getting sick and trading away all of your goods for that bottle of medicine, afterall.\\nI had heard of a semi-detached house. Some thugs were living in one part, but the other was completely abandoned. I thought I could sneak on through and gather  what I needed to survive the winter, but I was wrong. I was spotted by a girl and she immediately opened fire on me. I bolted for the exit, managing to stay alive but now I was wounded.\\nI would not let her make a fool of me!\\nThe very next night, I sent another survivor in. This time, I was armed with a knife and a mission. I was going to wipe that building clear of these lunatics so that they can't hurt anyone else. I was able to find myself a nice hiding spot and lured the shooter into a trap. As the frail girl creeped by me, shotgun in hand, I lunged out and stabbed her. She fell over, and I continued to stab until she stopped moving.\\nI turned around to find one of her friends behind me, watching as I sunk the blade of my knife in and pulling it back out repeatedly. I prepared myself to fight this new enemy, but she just dropped to her knees and bawled her eyes out. I was stunned as two other girls came running out and completely broke down in front of me.\\nI had helped cover for a neighbor from the militia. I had given some brave children my only bottle of medicine and two cans of food when I had hungry people of my own. I had gone out to help people trapped under rubble. I ran through a street covered by a sniper just to help an injured man get back to his infant child. I thought I could still keep my humanity in this horrible war, that I could hold onto this ideal that people are inherently good.\\nBut I had become a monster.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"A definitively charming retro throwback all about the classic pattern and level memorization to survive. It holds its influence on it's sleeve, but for what it's worth this is no Strider; it is very much it's own game with a distinct personality.\\nThe difficulty is understandably high, with a lovely amount of bosses and enemy variety. The combat and platforming is decidedly stiff but functional, and thankfully the game is built expertly around that. There is a ton of variety spread throughout; everything from vertical levels to speeder bike chases to robot polar bear grenade fights, you'll find there is a lot of fun and balls to the wall insanity to be had. Nothing is impossible and everything has a pattern, just like the oldies. As polished as this game is, you'll find that there will still be the occasional cheap death.\\nThe later stages are a great test of your abilities, and I made the foolish mistake to come back to them after a hiatus. I now officially suck, and my rustiness means I'll have to devote even more time if I'm ever to see the end.\\nStill, I've played more than enough to make an opinion, and I can tell you with the amount of content present in such starkly glorious retro quality, Oniken is a beautiful yet flawed homage to the old games of yore, and serves to establish it's own tongue-in-cheek identity that many new age retro titles fail to capture. The price it's asking for and the heart that's been put into its production shows a game that everyone should pay attention to, even if some of us lesser skilled gamers can't get past the final few levels without suffering an♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Definitely worth a buy.\",\n",

I know that sounds like utter hyperbole, especially when people call tripe like Bioshock Infinite the Citizen Kane of games unironically, but its not, KRZ is amazing to an almost baffling degree for a video game. KRZ is an adventure game focused on exploration and character development, the main crux of the gameplay is exploring the Kentucky backroads and the enigmatic Route Zero and having a hand in shaping the cast's personalites and pasts along their journey.\\nA melacholic sense of loss and slow decline just permeates throughout the game.The graphics are minimalistic but beautiful and really adds to this lonely and mysterious atmosphere. The level design  and how its all framed is also great and it can get quite unique, showing the game world in different and interesting ways. The game's fantastic soundtrack also really adds to the atmosphere and  it is used to great effect making for some really memorable scenes. KRZ's writing puts every other video game to shame and it has a creativity and skill that most games lack. The characters are also quite likable and you want to see their journey through. Overall KRZ just sucks you right in and really feels like you're on an adventure into the unknown.\\nEpisodes have been slow going but its been totally worth it. Wait if you want to, but if you buy it now you will not be disappointed. KRZ is just a great example of what video games can do with storytelling and really needs more love.\",\n",

That alone is a red flag behind this particular title.  With 4 months between\\nand\\n, we can see that not much has changed.  Only that you now have recorded footage instead of still images.\\nFrom my experience, I thought that most of this experiment was mostly just an exercise to showcase basic programming skills along with areas of the developer\\'s own interests, perhaps following his daily mindset.  The footage is well shot and great for getting still images, but outside of getting snapshots, the player may find themselves bored.  The music is not quite something I would enjoy listening to for a prolonged period.  The best footage is clearly the \"watch the cat\" footage, because...well...it\\'s cat videos, what\\'s not to love?   The worst footage is by far \"going to the exhibition\", which is what my nightmares are made of.  (Teddy bear plushes disturb me.  Even moreso since most of these look like they came out of a horror show.)\\nThe developer even notes \"useless tips\" that only seem to inflect negative self talk, which not all developers experience.  But the worst experience that I\\'ve experienced would be the actual gameplay for the good ending (the game even warns you that the bad ending is far superior, which it is).  The background constantly changes (white on white is a bad choice half the time) and you would be fooled into thinking the size of the shapes to choose matters.\\nOn top of all of this, the developer has footage of him reading a comic, which I\\'m fairly certain is protected by copyright of the comic\\'s creator.  I\\'m not certain if this footage would be allowed, especially without being remotely mentioned in the credits.\\nOverall, do I recommend\\n?  Because it\\'s just a video-formatted\\n, I cannot see myself recommending this game for any purpose outside of using the footage to get still-images from.  As a game, this game is quite disappointing, most of the experience is of irrelevant footage that only seems to be focusesd on procrastination.  So, again, would I recommend it?  Personally, no.  It\\'s priced at $1, but I wouldn\\'t pay a dime for it (though you could easily make that back up with the trading card drops you can sell on Steam Market).\\n2/10  Only good for purposes outside of its intended usage.',\n",

       "  'text': \"A Story About My Uncle follows a young boy who goes off searching for his uncle in a fantastical world inhabited by frog people. To do so he uses a device which lets him grapple to most types of walls in the world. And that is the basis of the game's gameplay. It's a first person platformer where the sole objective is getting from A to B. There are no diversions here, there are no enemies or sidequests or an open world to explore. You can find some collectibles along the way, but that's about it. Thankfully the game is very short so the platforming aspect doesn't manage to get boring.\\nAnd to that point it's a shame that the developers didn't really fully explore the complexities of the platforming they created with this game. There are checkpoints on almost every platform and the time you spend in the air is very short, so if you fail you probably lost around 5 secs of progress, which makes the game very easy (but also not frustrating, which is nice). Only at the very end you can start stringing together longer grappling jumps as a new option to refill your grapple device in the air opens up. Everything else is pretty straightforward.\\nThe world that they set up also feels underdeveloped, there are only passing mentions of it in the narration, and not much is actually explained. Perhaps there isn't much time to do that as the game length is about 2 hours if you're going just straight from beginning to the end. You can do some time trails on all the levels, and you can go back and select the level you want to replay if you'd like to get some perfect run achievements. Other than that there isn't much replayability in this short game.\\nAll in all it's a good first outing from the developer, the game simply feels underdeveloped in a lot of areas. Get it on a discount and you'll be fine with the purchase though.\\n6 / 10\",\n",

       "  'text': 'A short, Western-themed 2D platformer in the Mega Man vein.   A solid little game which can beaten in around an hour.  Levels are short but have no checkpoints so dying restarts the level.  Not too much of a problem except for a couple of levels that accounted for over half of my deaths.  Some of the level design is of the \"you need to die once to know what to avoid next time\" variety.  There\\'s also the feeling that the devs went down a platformer checklist when creating level features but some of the stuff they did is pretty cool.\\nBosses are pretty standard, not great, not bad.  Enemies drop gun power-ups and they\\'re mostly in the Contra style.  There\\'s no up/down/diagonally shooting, though you can shot while crouched and jumping and this stops feeling restrictive with a couple of minutes of playing. Your health bar doesn\\'t do a particularly good job of conveying how many hits you have until death, as you\\'ll get killed at times with what looks like to be a decent chunk left.  Game would\\'ve been better off just having some type of numeric representation of health, those this isn\\'t too big of a deal.  There are no game overs, you have infinite attempts at levels.\\nThere are three playable characters, Clive, Ms. Johnson, and the duck.  Ms. Johnson is clearly inspired by Peach from Mario 2 in how she controls, with the big difference between her and Clive is that she can float for a bit on her jumps.  The duck cannot hurt enemies but can jump/fly and is more of a challenge run character.\\nAll said, a decent little game with some replayability, though a bit on the boring/bland side at times but hey, it\\'s 2 buck at full price.  Worth picking up if you\\'re looking for a Mega Man-esque platformer.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Trials Evolution: Gold Edition is a 2.5D physics platformer that combines both Trials HD and Evolution into one package. You are tasked with getting across each level as quickly and with as little crashes as possible. Looking at some screenshots of the game you may think it is an action packed racing game but in reality it is about overcoming various obstacles in your path by using careful precision. Keeping your finger on the acceleration key will make it far more likely that you will crash in a spectacular fashion unless you are really skilled at the game. You can crash as many times as you like and still get a bronze medal as long as you cross the finish line but to unlock more levels to play you will need to go for gold or at least silver. The fewer times you crash and the quicker you get to the finish line, the bigger your reward will be. Aside from medals you will also be rewarded with cold hard cash which you can use to customize your rider and the bikes in your garage.\\nYou will automatically unlock new bikes the further you get into the game and they all have different ways of handling. Some may be heavier and slower while others will be fast and very prone to flip over if not careful. Handling aside, each bike you unlock is a straight upgrade to the one you were using meaning that you are unlikely to use those bikes ever again. There is one bike called the Micro Donkey that is unlocked by completing any track without crashing or leaning though for the life of me I could not accomplish this so I have no clue as to how the bike is. Customizing your bike and rider is solely for aesthetic reasons and has no effect on gameplay. You can color each part of your bike individually, making it look like you painted your bike with whatever spray paint you could find in the dumpsters if you so desire. As for different parts there are very little to choose from so most bikes will look the same minus their colors. Same goes for the rider, not much clothes to pick from though you can color him however you please.\\nStarting off you may be wondering which of the two games you should start off with but it doesn't really matter as you will have to constantly switch between the two as they are tied into each other. Whatever medals you earn in either will count toward your total to unlocking newer, harder tracks so you will have to play through both game's easy tracks in order to unlock medium difficulty ones. You can use the same bikes, same rider and the gameplay is exactly the same so it is very seamless, making it feel like one giant game. With the combination of two already decently sized games you will have a ton of content in this edition of the game. Trails HD no longer has its original soundtrack unfortunately and instead shares Evolution's soundtrack for some reason. Evolution also has a setback in that its DLC is not available for the PC which is really unfortunate since they were very fun. This version is by no means awful but I would suggest getting them on the Xbox 360 if that option is available to you.\\nPort quality of this title is solid, ran well and I've experienced no glitches or crashes. Most people's issues seem to be with the added Uplay DRM. It runs far smoother than the 360 version especially when there are lots of explosions going on, which is a large portion of the time. It being a 2.5D game means that the explosions going off in the background can't harm you and are there to look cool. You can only move to the left and right of the screen though when you are sent hurling off your bike after a crash you can fly face first into objects that can't normally be interacted with. It is a small unimportant detail but it never gets old sending your poor rider spiraling off the course and directly into some explosives. There is no gore or blood, he will just ragdoll into objects while occasionally letting off a very goofy scream. Trials does not take itself seriously at all and it is always tongue in cheek about things such as the descriptions for the levels that are often times references to movies or other forms of entertainment.\\nIt is goofy, it has respawn points littered seemingly every couple of feet and you can respawn as often as you want but Trials is by no means easy. It may start off as seemingly easy and boring but it will quickly kick off the training wheels, leaving you to fend for yourself as it giggles making you slowly drive your way over a row of highly explosive barrels. These insane, nonsensical things it puts you through is a huge part of its charm and in no time you will be riding through a WW2 battlefield, a floating island full of giant stone golems and a haunted castle to name only a few. You never know what to expect next since the theme of each level varies so greatly and so does the level design. Even after you think you have mastered the levels near the end of the game you will be able to earn a 4th platinum medal which require 0 faults and little time wasted. They are by no means necessary as by the time you unlock the ability to earn them you will have already unlocked all the levels, they are just there to add replay value and earn bragging rights.\\nAfter reaching the extreme difficulty tracks I'm just happy to get through a track and couldn't believe when I managed to get a silver medal on an extreme track even if I have played Trials since 2009. A neat feature incorporated into the game is the ability to view other player’s replays to see exactly how they got on the leaderboard and learn a few tricks from them. The community can even use the built in level editor to upload their created levels which are often time as good or better than the professionally made ones. It is a pretty powerful editor and I have seen the game turned into a First Person Shooter which was pretty mind blowing but honestly not that fun. There is tons of user created content to go through however the PC version has their own community that is separate from the Xbox version. That is really unfortunate since the Xbox version has been out much longer and has some amazing user created levels. Nonetheless what is here is typically pretty good and you will not be running low on tracks to play anytime soon.\\nAside from your typical tracks you can play through a variety of “Skill Games” which massively change up the core gameplay with crazy ideas such as attaching a rocket booster to your bike, riding on ski gear or flying a UFO. They are very creative and a ton of fun to play through a few times though they lose their appeal quickly. If you are low on medals they can be a lifesaver since they are usually easier to get gold on and there are a ton of skill games to swift through. The other mode is a simple tournament that has you riding through a gauntlet of tracks in order to gain some medals. Each track has their own leader-boards where you can compete against friends and strangers as well as a feature where you can upload your playthrough of the level directly to Youtube. There is just so much content to the game that you'll likely be playing it for a long time if the gameplay is to your liking. A demo is available on the Steam store page which is rare for a PC game but much appreciated and allows you to see if this is your cup of tea before buying. If you have the option of buying these games on the Xbox 360 I would suggest getting them there as Trials HD would feature its original soundtrack and Trails Evolution has some really cool exclusive DLC for it. If not, Trials Evolution: Gold Edition is still jam packed with content and is a very unique, addicting game that everyone should give a shot.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'What is up everyone I hope you are having a wonderful day. Early access is always a risky gamble but here’s one where the risk is literally almost free. We’re tuning into a 1v1 ranked match in Brawlhalla and we’ll kick started it with that.\\nSo far I will recommend this game. However, I do not suggest you buy any additional items at this time unless you are willing to try and be part of what could be the next big \"super smash\" on steam. ***This game has improved since it\\'s inception*** and has added some major updates to refine and introduce new features. As the big giant blue sign says though, the game is early access.\\nIn short, Brawlhalla is melee with the giant exception most of the battles can be fought in the air and some crazy and odd combos can be strung together. Also, here is a cool feature off the bat : the loading screen to play another online game let\\'s you battle it out with AI\\'s while waiting. Unlike Super Smash Bros. : Melee specifically, the game doesn\\'t have a \"fast\" feel to the game play. Rather, the game is smoothed out and requires proper timing (and the right button) to deliver an effective blow. The game is played generally in the air but the ground attack specials provide for more than enough umph and entertainment. The challenge to out whit your opponents seems equal at almost all odds. Some players will choose to take a precautious route while others will be willing to sacrifice themselves for a win.\\nBrawlhalla mimics in it\\'s corridors super smash. It is because it seems as the first reference to come to mind. On the other hand, it isn\\'t as I feel the strategies are really diverse and open to the player. There are character limitations and powers in both games but changing and throwing weapons distinguishes brawlhalla. Getting knocked off the map has become avoidable with all characters. When you think you\\'re dead or when you have no chance, it seems playing fields are almost even all the time. The edge of the map is a different game entirely here from smash. Think of kicking a soccer ball versus a golf ball. Being able to slide on the edges opens up a new dynamic (and possibilities) for both players. It seems as those who simply wait to strike at vulnerable times seem to win the most.\\nThe game is persistent in it\\'s work to differentiate itself from smash. Is this a good thing or bad thing you may be asking yourself? It\\'s neither really, until the game is done then a full judgment can be made. The scoring system seems to play the odds of K/D ratio\\'s while the HUD display simply shows it\\'s awesomeness in the top right (although I wish that awesomeness was a tad bit bigger in sprite size)! It\\'s tough sometimes keeping up with the fights, but the camera does a pretty good job of keeping you right where the action is. In other words, the zoom is definitely on the right track. Multiple game types make this game phenomenal. I can jump online with friends and play a free for all or play some two player ranked. It\\'s actually pretty nice to see considering it\\'s in the state it\\'s in.\\nThere are weapon drops in the game which resembles smash, but unlike smash, you\\'re allowed to throw away your main weapon at any time. There aren’t random weapons like smash but there is some variety. The weapon-drop will drop and can be picked up within a certain time by anyone. Each character is given two weapons consistent of axes, guns, spears, swords and not limited to javelins. In this sense, some characters have preferred fighting choices and when unlocked, can change their fighting stances (which can modify stats slightly but limited to local game modes only at the moment). Items are a nice addition to the game, and do not feel as though they tilt the odds. The longer the player holds the button down, the more umph goes behind the shot. Items include a spike ball, a bomb, a mine, and my favorite, the horn. The horn creates a line of fire across the screen and even delivers another weapon to the position you blew it from. I have to admit that this style of weaponry is actually nice. It\\'s breath of fresh air as it\\'s something new. If you get tired of using this, try using this instead. Don\\'t like this, go back to the other thing.\\nGraphics resemble those of Castle Storm but there is nothing wrong with that. The art style is nice and again, sets itself apart from smash. Sounds are good, but I would like to see a variance. Make a sword sound like a sword (even when thrown), and make a javelin sound different than a sword when it bounces off the ground. Stages didn\\'t sit well with me at first, but they do change over time. I felt as though they were a bit small, I still do but I can see why they are the size they are. I would suggest adding some levels that are larger and try to stay away from creating every level about the same size. I do like the physical changes that go on in the map, again another + for being different from smash. If you really want to get creative, maybe add certain objects that can explode, upgrade, or slow down players in certain spots (and maybe make them usable every minute or so).\\n****SEPT 2016 update\\nEverything is in good shape and the servers have finally improved. Game play is literally feeling in good shape and would maybe even like to see more mini-games? 4v4 local? Anything is welcomed as there is certainly no shortage on skins. I would also like to see the in-game coins be put to some kind of use in the future. Right now, everything seems dependant on Mammoth Coins. Mind you, these are only artificial changes not game re-structuring ones. I wouldn\\'t mind seeing some more maps added in the future as well. They\\'ve been adding characters every so often but no new topography! I\\'m excited to see what the final-release will have in store.\\nEARLY ACCESS RATING : 7.45/10 ***updated as Sept 2016\\nThe devs are actually really good at hearing out the community. Their also pretty effective in delivering their updates quickly in-game when it happens\\n***This review will be consistently updated throughout early access.',\n",

       "  'text': \"This is really fun! The combat (while derivative of other TPS) is solid, and the enemies, the 'robot-gore', and the environments are cool. The game also looks great, and the design is fantastic as well - the cityscape is wonderful to look at and really feels like a great blend of sci-fi futurism and gritty realism, and the character models are detailed and instantly recognisable. But the strongest feature of the game (in my opinion) are the cutscenes. The script is well written and the performances are pitch perfect and committed across the board. More importantly, I can follow the story and am invested in the characters, and I'm enjoying this more and more as it goes on.\\nI didn't realise that voice-recognition was such a big part of the game, and while it's gimmicky and can be frustrating at times, it is great fun at times to yell 'charge!' at one of your characters and have them respond to the command, throwing themselves into the enemy.\\nEverything that's great about it certainly makes up for any shortcomings in my opinion.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I am going to break this into 3 parts, singleplayer, multiplayer, and cooperative.\\nSingleplayer: 5.5 out of 10, fun to play, doesn\\'t get too bogged down. Props to Kevin Spacey for acting the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it.\\nMultiplayer: 3.5 out of 10, suffers from the same flaws as previous editions, some enhancements and flaws thanks to the new abilities. Server ping is a joke.\\nCooperative: 8 out of 10, something new, instead of survival and relying on team mates to revive you in the midst of a 400 goons+ attack, you can let your team mates die, instead of having to run into the middle of a pack of goons, and better yet, they keep their kit. I rate this.\\nSpoilers will follow;\\nSingleplayer:\\n1- I am F#$KING SICK OF \"THE GOOD GUY IS REALLY THE BAD GUY\". Please, Activision, nearly everything you\\'ve done since you focused on WW2 has had this same tired plot device. It\\'s not inventive, hell, I could see it coming a mile away.\\n2- I am just as sick of having to do missions where I have no \\'real\\' control. In the final mission, I have to stop a giant missile full of bio-weapons from firing, and am in an exosuit running down a fire filled launchway. This was stupid, because I was on fire in a fire filled environment and would have cooked to death. None of your future gadgets can stop me from realising the stupidity. Next, I could only fire at the missile once I got to the end of the corridor thanks to \\'fake\\' control, aka, through the exhaust gasses, and only once I got almost directly UNDER the ♥♥♥♥ing rocket engine. Lastly, on this point, rockets don\\'t take 5 minutes to take off from ignition. It\\'s pretty bad for the fuel supply.\\n3- What\\'s with our new main character? He looks like a nerd. IS this because you want to touch your audience on a subliminal level? He has mangy long hair, his facial hair is something similar to a 19 year old uni student... actually, ♥♥♥♥ it, I completely understand what you did there.\\n4- The campaign would have been mediocre if it wasn\\'t for the inclusion of new abilities such as threat grenades and the exosuit, otherwise, it was the same campaign I have played over the last decade of COD.\\n5- Minor grumble, but when you have an \\'action sequence\\' where I\\'m hanging off the side of a bus, or have to knife someone, don\\'t give me exactly 1 second to see the prompt and act on it. I won\\'t make it in time, and you\\'ll reset to my last save, which was at the start of said scene, about 5 seconds prior. This annoys me, because there is no point to it. I get to replay the same situation, only I now know what button to mash because I did it earlier.\\nRemember 90\\'s games? Weren\\'t they hard? None of this \\'respawn 5 seconds earlier\\' crap, it was \\'continue from the start of the level?\\'.\\nMultiplayer:\\nOk, real review. It\\'s the last COD multiplayer with jumping and cloaking fields. The guns and upgrades are unlocked by player level and kill-rewards, so bad news if you\\'re a casual looking to have fun, because you will be mercilessly gunned down the second you spawn, and some 12 year old will proceed to tea-bag your corpse and tell you he ♥♥♥♥ed your mum. Add to this, you are unfortunately in for LAG BY THE BUCKET. There are no dedicated servers at the time of writing, and the game suffers for it, with instinct being almost unplayable, even on my ASUS G75V. By searching for games to join of up to 800 ping, the server sets you up for failure.\\nAdd to this, the fact that the way the weapons actually function in multiplayer is a joke. I\\'m not terrible at the game, (not great either), and I have got to level 49 on multiplayer before doing this review in order to build up a fair opinion. I often will shoot an AK-12 or Bal into a person, at least 5-6 shots center mass and they will turn around and 1-2 shot me. I often watch the kill-cam and confirm this, which makes me really wonder if they are just THAT GOOD or if there is something wrong with the programing.. Also, the laser weapon (not the attachment, the actual heavy weapon) is broken, and the term \\'laser noob\\' is commonplace, as people wielding a couple of lasers can lock-down a hardpoint or domination game. The sniper rifles and side arms are all terrible, also, the melee option is a joke, with players able to slice you from several meters (a meter is about a yard) away at times. The submachine guns can sometimes pop you from about 100 meters away, and the assault rifle damage at times is a joke. Also, some players seem to have superhuman damage absorption abilities, as you can often watch a killcam with them on the red with blood all over their screen running at you and still knifing you to death, all whilst you are registering hits.\\nCooperative:\\nThe only genuinely enjoyable part of the game. No zombies now, they\\'re gone, and I\\'m happy with that. Frankly, zombies was ruined when they made the last Zombies in COD Black Ops 2, where it was all hard, and no fun. I know, I regularly played Zombies with mates and we didn\\'t laugh during the last Zombies like we did in original zombies or black ops. Also, an improvement over Modern Warfare 3\\'s survival mode, as there are no juggernaughts, and enemies are not made of diamond and impervious to your bullets. This isn\\'t to say it\\'s not challenging, rather, the enemies are hard to kill because they are sneaky, and well armed, not because the developers are lazy and just dial up their health bar by 10% each round. Also, an improvement is no \\'levels\\' to perk up on your character. Instead, weapons and abilities are unlocked during game as a reward for surviving. I like this, because it changes the challenge. In Modern Warfare 3, survival till level 25 because easy once I was level 40, because I just brought a machine gun with red dot, and mowed down enemies from a camping point with a sentry gun until the bots were too tough to hurt (that limit btw is about level 30, where you have 2 machine guns and a sentry gun, and so does your mate, and you don\\'t kill anything with a full mag...).\\nAll around, the game is fun. I say fun, not good. The gripes I have about the unoriginality with the single player and the broken multiplayer cause me to negatively view the game. I personally recommend survival, it\\'s something you can enjoy with mates, and you don\\'t need to have the levels and perks. As always, stay away from the multiplayer. I judged it not just because I knew what it was like in the past, but also because I actually have played through to level 49, and yes, I have the good guns with good upgrades, but I still get killed by those 12 year olds. That\\'s ok, I can kick their♥♥♥♥♥at N64 Mario Kart or Sonic 2 on Megadrive.',\n",

       "  'text': \"I'm not sure what all the bad press is about aside from the fact that it's so similar to Civ V. Yes they are very similar in the way they play and look. For me, I don't really mind too much, although I am glad that I got this on sale.\\nBeyond Earth, I think is great. It's the kind of Civilization that I've been waiting for. I just cannot play regular civilization anymore as I cannot properly immerse myself into the experience when I'm playing as English or the Aztecs on a random map where Ghandi of India is a warmonger and Ghengis Khan is a coward who asks for peace every time a stiff breeze rolls through his territory. Not to mention the map: even if you download a realistic Earth map, you might be Japanese starting South America or English starting Russia, America in Africa. For me those kinds of things ruin the immersion, though I'm sure they don't bother most people.\\nFor me, Beyond Earth solves these problems. You take control of a fictional futuristic faction that has landed on an alien planet.\\nIt is very similar to Civ and yes it's quite a lazy sequel I suppose, but that doesn't stop it fom being great in it's own right. Personally, I think the best Civ game so far, according to my tastes. I do think that more effort could have been made though. For example, the different map styles are done very poorly. The land in Archipelago style maps is joined via slithers of land, actually creating large continents. Forget the secluded, isolated territories then, if you liked them. With some community maps, this game would be perfect.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Well, where do I begin? With the fact that this game is an amazing re-creation of vintage FPS games? How about pointing out the great in-game design of the playing field? I'll just keep it simple.\\nThis game is simply amazing. The graphics are awesome, the movement is fun, and the idea is timeless. I was browsing through the free-to-play FPS games to kill some time while I got my old copy of Quake 3 Arena set up again and thats when I came across this game. If I'm just being honest, this is pretty much a knockoff of Q3A, but it's dissimilar enough that I really don't mind as it's still a very fun game to play. Mind you, I've only been playing the free version which, unfortunately, only comes with one playable map. However, that one map has got me hooked. I think that the developers did an amazing job with re-creation, and took great care in crafting the playing field. The gameplay is highly immersive, and will keep you playing for hours (if you're into this kind of game). The movement mechanics are pretty fun, too, and make it a very fast-paced game, just like Quake.\\nThe BIGGEST problem I can see is that there is a very, very small payer-base for this game. It's unfortunate, too. I would have guessed that more people would be into this kind of game as well, but I guess times change and people's gaming priorities will as well. If you do come across this review, though, and you've gotten this far.. Please give it a shot? It really is worth the free download at the VERY least. As for myself, considering buying the full download, I'll most definitely reconsider if I start noticing a larger player-base. For now I'm perfectly content with the free version.\\nThanks for the amazing game!\",\n",

However, after finally having gotten to play it, I can't help but getting a sour taste in my mouth.\\nWhile the art design and animation is superb, the aspect that it truly falls flat on is the puzzles, and that's pretty bad for an adventure game. There are truly only a handful of variations of puzzles throughout the whole thing, only ramping up in complexity each time, and the only way I can easily explain them is: Tedious. It felt like a chore to work through these puzzles, and I was actively looking forward to the whole thing being over after a while. I can only describe it as being boring.\\nIt's sad, but this turned out to be a prime example of why Kickstarter is such a gamble. You can see the love and dedication that the team put into this, but it is also painfully obvious that they ran out of time and money a lot sooner than they thought they would, leaving an end product that is neither satisfying or ultimately worth your time.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Just finished playing Wolfenstein: The New Order from start to finish.  Like many gamers, I like to spread my time out among a few different genres.  Sometimes I focus on JRPGs or RPGs, other times I play in a sandbox like Minecraft or A.R.K. and then every so often I fire up an FPS to get the adreneline pumping.  It\\'s refreshing to get engaged so quickly with a FPS like I did with Wolfenstein.\\nNow that I\\'ve completed it, I feel like I can say...\\nOverall, Wolfenstein is a good game - the graphics are excellent, the gameplay is fun and engaging, and the environments are interesting and eerie.  Though, it starts off grand and slowly looses steam the longer the player plays.  The game reminded me of one of those little toys that children play with where they wind them up and then let them down on the floor.  In the beginning, the toy zips away at top speeds but as the game plays on, it starts to wind down.\\nAlmost as if the designers couldn\\'t decide on whether they wanted it to be a story-driven RPG first person shooter, or if they wanted it to be a maniacle \"blow everything up\" type shooter.  It falls somewhere in the middle, but it feels like it doesn\\'t commit entirely to one or the other.\\nThe story is rather \\'okay\\'- but that\\'s to be expected on a game like Wolfenstein.  It\\'s not exactly Mass Effect, though it was touching that they put effort.  The voice acting was top notch and the attention to detail was very well done (news articles, letters, journal entries, etc).  The addition of Set\\'s character really added to the story and they definitely skimmed the surface of some sickeningly familiar concepts that we\\'ve dealt with in the real world (torture, erradication of jews, etc).\\nFor the sake of the \"quick and dirty\" review, I\\'d say if you enjoy FPSs and you enjoy Wolfenstein or other iD titles, it might be worth checking out.  I know I got the game on one of the famous Steam sales, so I definitely feel like I got my money\\'s worth.   I\\'d recommend it for anyone that wants a decent 12 hours of gameplay for a quick exciting experience.',\n",

As an expression of grief it is faultless, but as a game, I have a few reservations. That Dragon, Cancer, is very much a mixed bag. It\\'s a collection of touching scenes in the life of a sick child and his parents.\\nSome scenes express emotion quite vividly, such as when the parents meet their doctors for an update and prognosis, when you navigate Joel as he is carried on balloons made of surgical gloves, when Joel will not stop crying in the crib, and when he is cradled on the chest of his father Ryan during treatment.\\nOthers were perhaps too abstract or left me confused about how to proceed, such as pushing Joel on the slide, helping Joel ride the animals created from constellations, or prodding Ryan to swim when he is submerged. On a few occasions, I seemed to - almost - perform the action that was required of me, but then the scene would reset for me to try again. It\\'s possible that either these scenes were meant to evoke futility on the part of the player or that the game simply moves on if a player \"fails\" a scene too many times.\\nThrough what is depicted here, we see hope and hopelessness, faith and spiritual doubt, helplessness, and confusion, among other powerful emotions. If nothing else, the game is entirely genuine and authentic - I\\'ve never played anything else like it.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Okay, this is an unfair review.\\nLet this be a warning to unfortunate people, like myself, who grew up (and continue) to use game controllers for FPS games. I knew there was no controller support when I bought this game, but in the end, I just don\\'t have the keyboard-mouse skill to advance very far in this game.\\nMaybe I\\'ll be able to pull it off one day... until then: Controller FPSers, beware.\\nEDIT (in reply to helpfulness of this review):\\nThere\\'s no neutral review, and I\\'m disappointed that I cannot play this game, so it\\'s a negative. I feel that \"negative\" reviews on games with an overall \"positive\" rating (this game, has an 86% Very Positive rating) are more instructive than the \"positive\" reviews. Potential buyers read reviews before they read the forums in most cases. The caveat of telling review readers my opinion treats the game in an \"unfair\" manner and describing why clarifies my review rating.\\nI\\'m not hating on the game, or giving a bad review out of buyer\\'s spite. I suck at keyboard/mouse FPS controls and I wish there was controller support. Controller support is within the developer\\'s control. I knew that going in there was no controller support, but I wasn\\'t prepared for the high difficulty level of the FPS platforming.\\nThe difficulty in the game design is perhaps another point to let people know about. I made it through \"A Story About My Uncle\" (another FPS platformer) without a controller just fine, and didn\\'t think that it would be a problem for DeadCore. But it was a problem, and I couldn\\'t enjoy this game. I was hoping my experience could help people to understand that.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Explore the zombie-infested city of Los Perdidos, and find a way to escape before a military strike wipes the entire city, and everyone in it, off the map.\\nDead Rising 3 is a tpp zombie massacre simulator. It follows the Dead Rising formula, by chance you end up as one of the survivors of the zombie apocalypse and you must fight to survive zombie hordes and non-zombie maniacs, and get out alive. It has a specific structure where most of the mission have specific timeframes, miss the timeframe and the mission is gone. It's not as bad as it sounds tho as these timeframes in DR3 are quite generous, so as much as there is not much time to just sightsee there is time to complete all the mandatory and optional missions.\\nThe game itself is fun as usual. There are hordes of zombies and lots of ways to free them from this place of existence. The combo weapons are fun as usual and exterminating hordes of zombies using max level combo weapons is extremely satisfying. The PC edition includes all the dlcs, each dlc is a side story to the main storyline, which means 35-40hrs of reckless zombie murdering.\\nFor me DR3:AE is the best franchise installment by far (haven't played DR4 yet). You're still time constrained but there is enough time to do everything, included dlc content removes the time constraints so you can just roam and kill zombies. And killing zombies en masse is what Dead Rising does perfectly. The story is crazy, but well written and fun. If you like zombie games then give this one a try.\\nI liked:\\n* story\\n* (mass-) killing zombies\\n* crazy weapons\\n* music\\nI disliked:\\n* fps-drops (gtx970, but ancient cpu)\\n* no freeroam mode after finishing the story (you can freeroam in the dlcs as they are not timed, just without the costumes)\\nGet this if:\\n* you liked previous installments\\n* you like zombie games (and have a beefy enough pc)\\nDon't get this if:\\n* you don't like zombie games\",\n",

If the game gives you a path, follow the path as long as you can and don't explore. Rae moves too slowly for exhaustive exploration except in the first area.  There are some achievements you can get by exploring, but this is another case of achievements ruining your experience.\\n- When you see cyan swirls, press the action button!  This is your only way to progress.\\n= THIS GAME IS REALLY FLAKY WITH CONTROLLERS =\\nI left an earlier bad review for it because I thought Rae constantly going in circles was a feature - no, it was just a bug.  That seems to have been fixed, but it randomly decides it can't see my XBox controller when I start, takes a reboot.  So if your controls aren't working, just reboot the pc.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Greetings!  Today we have Prison Architect; a building management tycoon style game done with a (very) simple art style that started out as early access and now appears to be fully released.  Does it hold up to other Tycoon games and can it hold on to your hard earned money in an age of triple A graphics and adaptive AI?  Uhh...Yup.\\nWhat are you in for:  The game is more or less a standard building management game where you give orders to have things built, areas watched and things crafted but have no real direct control.  The twist comes from the fact that you aren’t hosting tourists, tenants or dungeon delvers but inmates.  Inmates that not only have to be kept in line but taken care of with a careful balance of mitigating harm to prevent escapes or deaths but also encourage education and reform; at first I really only cared about the former but the later does become very important as you start optimizing your prison.  This is a very simple interface but does have a few bugs and poor quality of life decisions, not all of the options feel intuitive and some tool tips are just plainly broken.   Some of it you just have to learn as you go and from trial and error; leaving the game definitely in an unfinished feel.\\nGo directly to Jail:  The game has a single player campaign disguised as a tutorial.  This threw me off at first as I was actually trying to initially rush through it thinking it would be a few minutes of story and then on to a sandbox.  Well, I can tell you I was wrong…and I am very happy at that.  I won’t ruin the story as I found it enjoyable with several twists and moments that I was sure the game was trying to sell politics until it immediately turned the coin over and showed the other side.  I found this story oddly intriguing and I did find that I was rushing objectives to get to the next plot piece.  I should note that each chapter of the campaign does relate so pay attention to each chapter; they aren’t stand alone.\\nMeeple City:  The graphics aren’t initially something that you think would have much to talk about but I found that they conveyed the information needed while remaining charming.  This is odd because I tend to lean towards more realistic graphics, though I will openly admit the sound was very forgettable and I eventually muted it.  As I stated above the controls could use some work (would like to know what items have access points without having to build and move).  I will say that I would have liked to see some more interesting options during the sandbox, can I accept corruption?  Maybe I have a VIP who needs to be protected?  Have an inspection I need to prep for?  Dirty guards that are on the take?  I mean the options are endless, I’d love to see these added in expansions.\\nSo, does this oddly animated kickstarter turned release hold up?  In a word, yes.  Simply put if you like tycoon or building management games you will get your money from this game.  Though many will disagree I did find myself at the cusp of being bored when I finished but the journey was well worth the crime committed (yay prison puns).  As always, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!',\n",

       "  'text': \"This is both a review for Halo Wars Definitive Edition, as well as what I think it means if more Halo games came to Steam.\\nHalo Wars. On PC. I freaked out when I found out - 20 bucks for the original game, improved graphics (...sorta), plus all the original DLCs.\\nI got chills when I opened the game. Hearing that amazing soundtrack - one of the best put into a Halo game to date - oh boy, it gave me the memories when I played it on the Xbox 360. The good old days, when you had games like this to play every now and again, and have a copy of Halo 3 or Halo Reach lying around to play splitscreen with your friends when they come over to your house. This game is without reasonable doubt worth the 20 bucks. Great value for a great game. Story is the same as it always is, with some of the - if not the best - cinematics put into a Halo game. Story lasts a good 6-7 hours. which is a nice lengthy campaign for a Real Time Strategy game. Overall, it's good to see a classic return.\\n8.5/10\\nAnd I would like to see me. Much. much more. *cough* Halo 3 Remastered *cough*\\nNow that I got that out of the way, what do I think about Halo games coming to Steam? Do I want to see more? Absolutely. But only certain games. To me, the games that feature The Master Chief, (Halo CE, Halo 2, Halo 3, Halo 4, Halo 5) should remain an Xbox Exclusive. That is because he is Microsofts FPS man. That deserves it to remain on console. But...for the games that don't feature The Master Chief? They would be a new revolution for Steam. Halo 3: ODST would make a warm welcome to Steam. Halo Wars 2 may even be welcomed. But I'm wanting the big Halo. The Best Halo. Halo Reach. A game with such good maps, gamemodes, customization, and creativity would become a new Bestseller. Halo Reach wouldn't be a Halo game on Steam. It would be THE Halo game on Steam. And if that day comes, which it could, but may not, then I will be the happiest person in the universe.\\n- i am sam\",\n",

       "  'text': 'A great turn-based strategy game with RPG elements. There are many aspects I like about this game, including the combat mechanics; although the game can occasionally seem unfair (how could I miss with 80% hit chance?), it is actually a well-thought out system that works very well for the most part. I like how there are two different play modes - one is the on ground combat, and the other is managing your base. Think of the management aspect like a simplified Civ game. You are responsible for hiring scientists and engineers, building specific rooms, managing finances, hiring soldiers, deciding which soldiers to genetically modify, to name but a few. I also like the way each solider type (heavy, assault, support, and sniper) have their own tech trees. They are slightly limited, but enough to keep it interesting. The expansion adds plenty of content, such as new missions, weapons, and enemies.\\nNegatives are fairly minor. I feel there could have been more environment types (they get very stale after a while). Animations are sometimes a bit off, not enough to ruin the flow of the game, but they are noticeable. There is one enemy where their turn takes way too long, and can be irritating to wait for it to finish, especially when you are looking to load to a previous save.\\nOverall, a fantastic turn-based strategy game. Certainly one of my favourite stratey games. If you are late to the game like I was and enjoying good strategy, I recommend buying this ASAP.',\n",

It lures you in with the promise of a better ending, only to sucker punch you at the end.\\nSo do I recommend this game? No, not really.

I'd happily pre-order any future final fantasy game from SE without a second thought.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Finally a game that is worthy enough to compete with games such as Amnesia or Outlast.  I have lately reviewed many horror games and they have all been more or less garbage compared to theese two.  Nothing comes even close until this game came along.\\nShortly the game is about an artist who delves deep into madness as he creates his masterpiece using methods and tools that are more than questionable. In the process everyone around him gets hurt really bad. As an added bonus there is a chapter where the daughter of the main protagonist later comes back to the house to witness the carnage of her childhood and pick up the pieces.\\nGameplay is harrowing experience of flashbacks and exploration as the road to madness really is something. It is worth looking for details in the environment,. Some gameplay related cons do exist though, for example early game is 'door opening and drawer opening/closing simulation' as some negative reviews have correctly explained. But as the madness progresses there is less and less of this and more... madness. And the painting does come along nicely and end result is something i did not quite expect.  Nevertheless i'd like to point out that the best parts are by far the narrative thick sections that explains what happened and the less than stellar sections are the endless corridors with yet another door to open.\\nGame does not have much action in it so those who look for mad running from enemies such as in Outlast will not find any. Also there is no hiding from monsters such as in Amnesia.  The beef of the game is to witness the quickly advancing decay of the family as everything goes to hell because of the protagonists obsession with a painting.\",\n",

While the layout of each mission is scrambled (as well as the topology of the \"hulks\" to explore), the randomness is quite low, so it doesn\\'t take much before everything gives a deja vu feeling\\n- rigid game structure\\nthe game is subdivided in seasons and, while it is a nice touch that fits into the general concept, it comes a time when you just want to either pick a random mission and get wild, or replay one of the missions you already did.\\nSure, there is \"The Void\": a streak of unlimited random generated missions, but they are differently structured and are not as satisfying as the original game [EDIT: the void is totally cool. At some point you build some tolerance for the spinning ;-) ]\\n- sluggish transitions\\nbetween pretty much everything there is a anime intermission with the pilot winking, the ship starting, ecc ecc. Now this is great when it\\'s done to hide some loading time, but the developers really overdid it. Guys, can I just shot some fu...rs, please??? :)\\nThat said, the game is so damn good, you can forgive it pretty much everything, as long as you give yourself the time to get a bit good with it: the dogfights are a chaotic mix of physics and environmental based combat where you dance and slide with your vehicle while transforming from fighter launching missiles barrages, and mech pulling and throwing stuff around.\\nThe graphics is stunning and the audio does its job remarkably, with touches of styles like the pilots intercoms during the fight (a nod to the anime material the whole game is inspired from), and the game is sparkled with humor and references (one of the enemy pilots is dressed like the protagonist of Guacameleee :DDD).\\nRegardless...\\nYou get to pilot a space ship that transforms into a mech, and feel like a total badass in the process. What the f#%$ do you want more than this?? =)\\nHighly recommended!',\n",

Fewer ambiguous puzzles, more substantial hints, and better explanations. All around the puzzles were much better designed, and as a result, I had a much better time with this game. The major downside, however, is that this game is easier than the first. Even the game's hardest puzzles only took maybe 5-10 minutes. A few puzzles might be more difficult for people with no background in math... something to consider. The story continues from the first and I thought it was decent, but it's more plot-driven and loses some of its charm in the rush.\\nIf you were able to stomach Puzzle Agent 1, then this will be a welcome improvement. If you're a fan of puzzles, this isn't as good as the Layton games, but it's cheaper and still fun.\",\n",

I certainly recommend it to those who like to solve puzzles and have a pleasant time. :)',\n",

Yet i kept thinking theres just not enough content, not enough maps, monsters, traps or weapons…then I released that during free weekend all the additional content was free so thats it, everything the game had to offer to promote itself and it was nowhere near enough.\\n- DLC, we all know about this…the costs are atrocious.\\n- Maps, not are they lacking in quantity but also in quality..how this has been overlooked is beyond me.\\n- Single player is pointless.\\n- There are 3 multiplayer modes…seriously and one of those is skirmish but the other two are identical. Evacuation tries to put a cinematic story edge to the multiplayer which is a complete and utter flop.\\n- The price, for the lack of content amount of dlc and small player base the only way this game is worth buying is for less than £10 with all the DLC thrown in or free to play with the DLC as micro transactions.\\nVERDICT?\\nI was genuinely having fun with this game but over time it becomes boring and how shallow it is becomes so blatantly obvious.',\n",

Playing Left for Dead as a kid kind of let me feel nothing in regards to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ loot, because there was no loot in Left for Dead. Why are you mentioning Left for Dead, you might ask? Well, this game borrows many concepts from L4D, (in fact, you can argue that Vermintide is basically modelled after L4D) such as the enemy mobs equating to those zombie mobs in L4D.\\nThat said, if you are unfamiliar with the Warhammer setting, it is quite easy to say that there is only war everywhere and everything wants to kill you (on a less extreme than Warhammer 40,000). The enemy of the game, the Skaven, are humanoid rat people who are overruning the city of Ubersreik. The description of the game by the developers offers a pretty solid explanation of what's going on.\\nVermintide revolves around you and three other companions (from a total of 5 to choose from, the Dwarf Ranger (melee/ranged combatant), the Imperial Soldier (same), the Witch Hunter (primarily ranged/mixed), the Elven Ranger (same), and the Bright Wizard (primarily ranged/magic). Completing a series of objectives to accomplish a mission, you and your party must venture through the rat-infested city to do so. It is quite fun, although replayability might not be a strong suit. With this said, bear in mind there are minor bugs and some kinks that the devs haven't worked out yet. If you can look past these, I'd say you'd love this game.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Dead Rising 4 is an open-world zombie-slaying sandbox, and it\\'s awesome. The world is rendered in loving detail. Honestly this may be the most detailed open-world I\\'ve played to date, other than RPGs like Fallout 4. Almost every building and store is enterable and fully detailed. Lots of objects are interactable and can be used to bludgeon zombies and hostile survivors. It\\'s just grade-A pure fun♥♥♥♥♥♥and a blast to play. The centerpiece of the setting is the Willamette Parkview Mall, a surburban megamall. Presumably it\\'s the rebuilt mall from Dead Rising 1. It\\'s an amazing and hilarious place to explore, complete with themed sections and employee tunnels. If you\\'ve ever just wanted to blow things up and have fun in a shopping mall, this game has that.\\nHaving said that, Dead Rising 4 has a couple of problems.\\nFirst, compared to the earlier games, some gameplay elements are gone. Dead Rising 3 has a more robust hand-to-hand melee system and you can throw weapons. That\\'s absent here. But I don\\'t really see any problems. My biggest complaint is that they took out the weapons locker from Dead Rising 3 so now you have to manually re-collect any weapons from their original locations. If I want the halberd I gotta go all the way back to Medieval Town in the mall.\\nMuch more serious is that they took out psychos and the psycho cutscenes. Having just started playing Dead Rising 3 also, I\\'d say that\\'s a big step backward because that game had some ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious psychos. Dead Rising 4 still has maniacs, but these guys lack all of the satirical humor of the earlier psychos. And no cutscenes of course.\\nThese cutbacks notwithstanding, the gameplay component itself is much improved from the earlier games. Combat is more visceral. The blood is more plentiful. There are dynamic blood arcs and splatters. Zombies number in the thousands on-screen, and performance remains great. This game actually has better performance than the PC port of Dead Rising 3 despite the vast improvement in visuals.\\nThe second problem is the playable character Frank West. A lot of people have a problem with his voice actor and appearance changing compared to Dead Rising 1 and 2. I never played those games. I don\\'t have a mental image of how the \"real\" Frank West should be like, but I love Dead Rising 4\\'s Frank West. The man is ♥♥♥♥ing badass and hilarious.\\nThe game does have a small problem with inconsistent tone. But I never found it as jarring as a lot of other players and reviewers. People make it seem like you\\'re watching Schindler\\'s List punctuated by Jerry Seinfeld segments, and that\\'s just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Does this game have a tone problem? Yeah. Like in one instance towards the beginning one character accidentally has an Anthony Weiner phone moment, and that spoiled the seriousness of the scene. But really egregious stuff like that is rare.\\nOverally, try it. It\\'s hella fun.',\n",

The enemy AI is really great and sometimes even challenging in certains parts of the game even in normal difficulty. You can play in which ever order and each one gives you a slightly different experience.\\nAs the Marnie, the game takes the traditional route like any FPS with you typical arsenal of weapons but with a survival horror twist. When playing, you really got to be on your toes and stay alert as the xenomorphs can pop out of nowhere.\\nAs the Alien, the game shifts to a 1st person stealth game as you lurk through vents and pick off the enemy one by one. Stealth is the key and the darkness is your friend. To regain health as the Alien, you must devour your prey. Playing the Alien is my personal favorite.\\nAs the Predator, the game is a mix of stealth and the ability to use your wide varity of gadgets with a touch of brute strenght. The predator is the more powerful of the 3, but however don't get too cocky. Predators can be killed too. To regain health for the Predator, he uses a gadget in his arsenal with also drains power. Just remember, electric weapons such as the blaster and should cannon use power.\\nThe game's story is not as great as the previous two Aliens vs Predator games and at times can be murky but it makes up for it in the gameplay.\\nIf you are a Aliens vs Predator fan, you will not be disappointed as it stays true to the Aliens vs Predator lure. I rate this a 8/10.\\nIf you know know nothing about Aliens vs Predator than this game could look average to the casual FPS gamer and may come on as a 6/10.\",\n",

I had no desire to spend 50 dollars on a genre that I don’t even enjoy that much, but at 14.99 I feel like I outright robbed the devs.\\nGraphically Wolfenstein is stellar; I didn’t encounter a single muddled texture or janky pop-in. Animations are natural and varied. The gun effects are meaty and unbelievably deadly feeling. Sound design reflects this quality with heavy, forceful gunshots and chaotic combat chatter as you mow down nazi foes. Everything about the presentation is just perfect.\\nBut every modern FPS is shiny, the problem is that they are all bland, stale, predictable, and just plain boring to play. Not Wolfenstein, dear god not this game. You are unnaturally quick, agile and can leap and slide about the stage whilst dual wielding assault rifles.When the game gives you guns, it wants you to go ape with them. On top of that, Wolfenstein goes back to the good ol’ days of magical bottomless pockets, allowing you to carry about a full arsenal of chaos to use as you see fit. Gunning down one room only to slide into the next stealthily tossing knives into the backs of any nazi whose back is foolishly turned is pure joy.\\nAs if making a good feeling shooter in this day and age isn’t reason enough to celebrate, the storyline and character development is mind blowing. Sure the emotions won’t be running as high as your first time playing The Walking Dead, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t swept away into the struggles of the protagonist and his rag-tag group of freedom fighters. With some seriously dark and difficult topics hit on with such taste and creativity, when the cutscenes are rolling it’s hard to believe this is an old school nazi killing arcade. That is, until the tone switches to absurd 80’s action movie mode and you gather around the round table to hatch a crazy plot to mow down more nazis. When you can go from entering a concentration camp-witnessing all the horrors associated with a locale of that nature- to melting nazis on the moon with laser assault rifles and never breaking the flow of the narrative or gameplay then you have accomplished something magical.\\nI could harp all day on how each part of Wolfenstein is expertly crafted, but the pinnacle of achievement here is the inconceivably masterful balance between so many conflicting styles, themes and narratives. Wolfenstein: The New Order is by far one of the best games I’ve played in 2015.',\n",

The secrets are easy to find, and the map does all the work telling you where the \"secrets\" are. The \"twist\" about being a lesbian and building up over Lonnie is just kind of a let down in the end.  The story told in letters does somewhat grab the emotions on the whole \"lost love\" feeling, but the payoff at the end just really drops the ball here.  I went in expecting more of a mystery over the whole \"psycho house\" thing you read about a little bit, and the odd phone messages, but it really leans more for the lesbian lover in letters collected.  Also, one gripe I kind of had was the fact that some of the letters, while really well designed, felt I could barely understand because of the handwriting curves (not all, but some).',\n",

Is it recommended? Yes, but definitely one for the sales!\\nThe bundled SiN is a better game but is of course much older and really hasn't weathered well at all. It also needs a special bug-fix downloading that is very difficult to find.\",\n",

All three stories are connected with logical connection, and what happened in GTA IV has affect on these two stories (EFLC - Episodes From Liberty City). Or let's say it has affect on it. It's not like it has some real affect, but it was made to have the affect on it. And it has.\\nBoth expansions shows something of both worlds. TBoGT is showing classy high & luxurious style of life while TLaD is showing underground, real side of America. In overall I do like TBoGT more, but Johnny was truly awesome in TLaD.\\nThere's also one mission where all 3 characters meets up but now shhh about it. Same with intro. For the price you see at Store Page, you will get two precise full games not just expensions as they are called. Also they're BETTER OPTIMALIZED than GTA IV. So you don't have to worry about your hardware as much as you had to back then with IV.\\n(for both)\",\n",

The cutscenes and cinematics are AMAZING as they are more animated and have better graphics than the actual game. Save points are common enough and there isn't a huge emphasis on grinding. However I like the battle systems from the earlier Final Fantasy games better, the battle system for FF8 is good. You need to press G right when you land your attack to deal extra damage. It's a cool little feature, but personally I prefer the more simple battle systems found in the earlier Final Fantasy games. Namely: Final Fantasy 3. All in all it's a great game! 8/10\",\n",

To me, it stands strong among others like Gothic for example, in terms of being unique and sucking you in.\\nIf you want to know what this game is: Ambiguous answer would be Dark Souls RTS, a better description would be very hard, survival, zombie, rogue like rts game.\\nThe good:\\n+ soundtrack - catchy and fits the theme\\n+ I generally don't like steam punk settings but this game pulls it off beautifully\\n+ zombie game done right (it's hard to use something as overused as zombies and make it interesting\\n+ simple elements put together skillfully\\n+ randomization of maps\\n+ decent array of building and defensive options, with soldiers having advantages for different scenarios\\n+ excellent combination of tower defense, rts and rogue like\\n+ plenty of resources to manage, basic ones: wood, stone, gold, iron, oil etc., slightly more complex ones like population, food and then complex like space, you have to not only think how to secure resources but plan your expansion and optimise building cluster\\n+ some buildings have impact on other and should be built in proximity to boost benefits of the economy\\n+ simple rpg like mayor system giving you small benefits, but also forcing you to make a choice\\n+ clear, neat, good looking graphics\\n+ major and minor zombie waves\\n+ zombie towns - you can attack them and get extra rewards or avoid but this could have an impact later on if you dont have the map cleared properly\\n+ Dark Souls of rts genre\\n+ learning from your mistakes\\n+ hard, you won't win every time, but getting owned by the game is so much fun as you usually lose because of your mistakes\\n+ sometimes randomised map seed is stacked against you but even if I feel I am at a disadvantage I am giving it a go to see if I can adapt to adverse conditions\\n+ frequent updates\\n+ survival mode already providing hours of fun\\n+ price tag wasn't overly big and given coming to the game (40-50h campaign, new buildings and units, workshop to allow moding and possibly map making with potential coop or multiplayer maybe, its gonna be super worth it, I feel it already is)\\n+ devs are fairly responsive, despite being indie company\\n+ fairly helpful community, lots of players out there who are willing to give you tips, there are guides available\\nThe neutral:\\n* some people report issues/bugs etc. but I haven't experienced any\\n* difficulty not aimed at beginners\\n* certain people can find this game repetitive - mostly because at this stage of the Early Access its just the survival mode\\nThe bad:\\n- at this point in time Mayor choices are not really choices, I mean they are either too easy or both options you are presented with are just equally bad\\nI know, it looks like I am a total fan boy but I can't fault the game at the moment, I understand this is Early development, there are bugs and balancing issues to fix, features and content to implement. I will have a more critical approach once game leaves Early Access officially.\\nHopes:\\n~ I am hoping the campaign won't disappoint\\n~ map editor (workshop confirmed)\\n~ new factions or maybe mods changing change would be cool\\n~ I would love to play a reverse version and control zombies XD\\n~ playable zombies to allow typical rts like games\\nI very rarely take interest in Early Access but I couldn't wait to jump and support this one, especially seeing as I have missed the Kickstarter campaign. With games like this one I am very happy for the Early Access option on Steam.\\nNumantian - you have done a great job, keep it up!\",\n",

       "  'text': 'If Max Payne 2 was a humble, faithful sequel that simply improved upon the technical flaws of the original while keeping mostly everything the same, then Max Payne 3 is the Hollywood blockbuster that broke new grounds for a wider audience who were unfamiliar with the original. This isn’t a criticism about Max Payne 3 being different from what people originally loved being forgotten for the sake of sales; instead, it’s recognizing that with Rockstar having full control of the series it’s not a game that adheres to what Remedy believes made Max Payne so beloved.\\nIn many ways, from its narrative and gameplay, Max Payne 3 is my favorite in the franchise despite how much fondness I have for the originals, and it’s simply because of how different it is in its style, presentation as well as deviations on the core Max Payne experience. That is not something I can often say about a sequel that changes so much yet it retains the identity of the qualities I enjoyed the most about the original. The foundation of what makes these games so great is still embedded within all the deviations that kept me coming back to spend as many rainy days of Max’s downfall in New York to the sunny reflection off his bald head in the turmoil of Brazil.\\nAlthough the term isn’t the correct film genre, Max Payne 3 is a neo-noir adaptation from the series’ original adherence to the classic film noir style with its own quirks. Instead of graphic novel cutscenes with as much grit and wit as a Harry Blotch novel, MP3 adopts in-game engine cutscenes both playable and not playable that make the cinematics part of the standard gameplay. Instead of the romanticized underground crime-organizations of New York, São Paulo is a realistic city full of corrupt officials from politicians to policemen fueling a cultural divide and an economy where the poor people fuel the elite upper-class. Even Max himself undergoes a visual change that makes him appear an angry gringo on a vigilante mission much like the original game where the language barrier itself becomes a part of the narrative that alienates Max as an outcast hero trying to do what is right in a part of the world where his Americanized notions of justice appear meaningless.\\nFor all these visuals, narrative and gameplay changes, they retain the ideals of Max Payne where they blend two mediums together, namely film and videogames, into a cinematic—not frame-rate related—experience into a league of its own. As a result, I can respect what MP3 attempted to accomplish as it manages to stay mostly true to the series’ roots while expanding upon them as sequels should, even though the Rockstar levels of adult subjects like pandering prostitution can take away from its social commentary on the real-world politics of São Paulo. If these changes bother you or make you question if you are playing the same type of game, then that was the purpose behind these changes as you are put into Max’s shoes of being unfamiliar from the conventions of his past games.\\nNot every change is easy to accept as others such as the constant visual effects on the screen that attempted to visualize Max Payne’s deviation from sobriety and his constant drug usage. Even if you can accept the changes in its storytelling, the Rockstar-ification of Max Payne from Max Payne 2 continues its lack of subtlety and campier elements that made the previous games beloved. Perhaps of all the controversial changes that will divide fans the most are the gameplay adjustments that may not be tolerable to people who despise the constant interruptions to the original’s natural flow of storytelling and gameplay.\\nSomething I have yet to express in my previous reviews of Max Payne is that while I always enjoy replaying them to experience the story I have never really enjoyed how long they are. In fact, one reason why I liked MP2 more than the original was that it was more concise to never overstay its welcome. Having explained my stance on previous games, it should be telling that MP3 only began to wane in its final hours when levels began to feel like padding even though the game is far longer than the previous two combined. This is what I attribute to the game having excellent pacing as well as constant changes to the gameplay through the visual effects of the level-design and playable cutscenes interspersed with the non-interactive cutscenes and the hands-free battles.\\nIt can be understandable why the constant interruption to take way the player’s controls can become irritable to diehards who simply want to play as well as the changes to the weapon system limits. This latter issue is something I believe fixes a reoccurring problem in the past games where certain weapons became worthless over the course of the game by making every weapon viable, and MP3 is a case where having less weapons (two side-arms and one two-handed gun) makes for a better experience. On top of the gameplay benefits, this limit ties into the dynamic cinematic system of using the player’s arsenal during the cutscenes as well as making some of them playable, not including the dynamic bullet cams and thousands of animations on Max, to make the whole experience as smooth as possible whereas the graphic novel cutscenes of old always made the story and gameplay feel separated. As a whole, the approach to do less with the gameplay to create more spectacle is something that is to the game’s credit, which is why when you install the Payne Evolution mod for MP2 the controls from MP3 feel like the refinement the series always needed.\\nOne complaint I will somewhat agree is to the detriment to the gameplay is the gameplay’s adherence to reward more cover-based playstyles than having no cover from the original. As someone who played all three games back-to-back, I could play most of MP3 without having to hug the cover as Max retains his mobility and his bullet-time to reward skill players. (The addition of a second-chance when holding painkillers also is a blessing.) However, there were situations where there was a lack of cover to naturally weave in and out of as well as armored enemies that can only be killed with a lot of ammo to encourage turtling up on walls. This change is something I find harder to accept as the playstyle is mostly doable on hard mode, yet eventually the player will be encouraged to play the safest way to avoid restarting checkpoints too often.\\nNow do I believe all these harmful changes made to the Max Payne legacy were done without respecting the original source material from Remedy Entertainment? No, because if anything Rockstar went to great lengths to respect previous players by giving them a truly mature storyline with a likable character who retains all his lovable qualities as well as respecting the secret ending of Max Payne 2 by nether confirming nor denying that Mona Sax survived. That level of commitment to respect the series’ history is a sign that this game was attempting to do something true to the original while being innovative, and I wish more developers had the cojones to tackle established series with as much risk as Rockstar did to innovate Max Payne for the modern age.\\nAs much as I would like to see Rockstar continue Max Payne’s legacy beyond the surprisingly happy ending after all the hardships he has been through, the finality of MP3 is what makes me enjoy replaying the series as a whole. If Max is left sipping away his days on the beaches of Bahia to move on with his life for once, then I cannot think of a greater send-off to a series than that final shot of Max free from his inner monologues walking off into the sunset.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The Brothers in Arms series is my favorite in the WW2 FPS genre, but this is definitely my second favorite. It\\'s essentially the same formula you see in most WW2 shooters, but instead of having linear levels, each mission is a reasonably large map with multiple objectives that you can take on in any order. The game drops you into the map by airplane, and you can parachute to wherever you want to start (there are designated green smoke \"safe zones\" where the enemies don\\'t spawn, but you\\'re generally free to experiment with landing wherever you think would give you the best advantage). You can find a decent amount of standard WW2 guns throughout the levels, and each of them has 3 levels of upgrade attachments that you unlock after getting a certain amount of kills with each one.\\nWith that being said, there\\'s a reason it\\'s only my second favorite. For one thing, the game is really short - it only has 6 missions, which each last somewhere close to an hour each. They\\'re largely unconnected, and for the most part the other soldiers are all just a bunch of faces, with no real narrative or characters to give more purpose to the nazi killing like you might be used to in other shooters in the genre. The game\\'s AI is also pretty severely lacking, and tend to navigate the levels in a way that hints that they weren\\'t really ready to make a game where you aren\\'t on a set path. It\\'s not usually noticeable for the enemies that are spawned into the game when you first begin a mission, but for freshly spawned enemies and allies it can be pretty bad.\\nOverall I\\'d still recommend it, if only because it\\'s so old now that it\\'s only $10, which in my opinion is worth it for a game as fun as this even as short as it is. But if $10 for 6 hours isn\\'t enough for you, it might be better to wait for a sale. Either way, I\\'d recommend it if you like WW2 games.',\n",

The realism in this game is not accurate. I feel like there would be more weapons lying around in real life.  My whole experience with this game amounts to starting up, wandering around, seeing a zombie, now there are 5-10 zombies running at me, running for my life with nothing but a can of beans and whatever stock items I have on me, summoning up the courage to fight and kill a zombie, learning that basic attacks i.e. punching suck in this game, dying. The next play through (6 months later) I decided to play sneakier. So if I saw a zombie I'd just try my best not to pull aggro, and continue searching for some kind of weapon. Welp, that would eventually just lead to dying. My 3rd and final try at the game was the exact same experience as the 2nd, with that I quit, uninstalled for the 3rd time, and never thought about it again until now, when I am writing this review (2 years later).\\nWhat can I say about it, when it has such a high learning curve, no initial thrust into it's environment, and no real goal at hand? I didn't expect a story, or anything of Minecraft proportions, but I did expect to at least shoot a gun or two, or maybe even play with other people. That's one thing I forgot to mention, every time I played, I never ran into anyone on the servers. I saw people online in the servers, but never saw anyone playing in game. Another thing to mention is how bland the world is in this game. It's boring, the houses have nothing going on in them. there is nothing to do at all except die, die, die.\\nI even gave this game a huge chance seeing how it was early access. I see people complaining about how it still is early access even after 3 years. Personally, I don't mind because it makes it feel like it's still 2013, which is nice.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I\\'m very nearly not recommending this, but it gets a pass. If you\\'ve already played Sonic Generations and Sonic Mania (which isn\\'t out yet but reviews are great so far), and you want a Sonic-feeling PC game, then this is a good pick. It\\'s fun and fast, with great art and music.\\nUnfortunately it\\'s far from perfect. The story and voice acting are cheesy and weird and not really in an enjoyable way. I wish the levels were shorter, as you kind of have to commit yourself to a half hour every time you sit down. The cut scenes are quite long, and if the levels were split up a bit like the zones in Sonic games, it might make the cut scenes easier to get through.\\nThe hit boxes sometimes behave strangely, and there\\'s next to no invincibility after you get hit, so getting juggled and losing most of your health is common and not fun.\\nAlso the collectables in the game are completely pointless. To compare, in Sonic the rings are also your health, you drop rings when you get hit, if you collect 100 you get an extra life. In Shovel Knight, a different indie pixel art 2D retro-style platformer, the money you collect is for upgrades and you lose some when you die. In Freedom Planet, you collect crystals. You never lose crystals, and if you collect 200, you gain an extra life. Now in Sonic, if you lose all your lives- that was it- game over. In Shovel Knight, they\\'ve done away with lives and given a well-designed check point system that takes money when you fail and rewards risk-taking. In Freedom Planet, if you run out of lives you gain five more. That\\'s it. There is no penalty whatsoever for losing lives. Meaning lives don\\'t matter, meaning crystals don\\'t matter. Why do the crystals exist? No one knows. What a bafflingly stupid design choice.\\nThe difficulty scaling is also way off in my opinion. The levels are all incredibly easy, since death means nothing the only goal is really to get to the next checkpoint, so health is a minor concern. So the bosses are the real challenge of the game, with the quality of them varying greatly. The first few bosses are quite easy, and then there is a sudden difficulty spike. All of the bosses are manageable until the third phase of the final boss, which suddenly gives no tells and is completely randomized in how to operates. I beat it, but if felt more like I got lucky than anything skill-based.\\nDamn, that is a lot of bad things for a positive review. I\\'m a very negative person. There are a lot of games to play before Freedom Planet, and it\\'s \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" score is unearned in my opinion. But it feels like Sonic 3 when you\\'re speed through the world, and that\\'s what I was looking for. Get it on sale.',\n",

Tanks are customized with the following: wheels/jets/etc, main hull, turret, weapon(s), and supports. It's extremely simple, and adds a bit of thinking since too much weight can slow the tank, and weigh down crawlers. However, one thing truly makes this game stand out:\\nThe free-to-play games usually rely on players making purchases. This does not.\\nWhile some may deeply disagree, hear me out.\\nOn the totally free version, you are not bombed with offers. You are not restricted from important features. Only two items can be purchased, Basic, and Premium. On free, you are limited to 10 purchased parts, and can earn more by leveling up. On basic, you have unlimited parts, and premium gives you access to\\nparts. You can sell unused parts, as well. In all, you can dominate the battlefield without paying for anything. And yes, it is a little difficult to level up, but you can earn at least one gold in any match (parts cost anywhere from 5-15 gold), and sell other parts.\\nThe only real problem I have is that there is no chat filter. Most of the time, everyone's to busy playing to talk, but people will often visit the chat to rage.\\n8.5/10 overall\",\n",

       "  'text': \"This game is, by far, one of my favorites. I've been playing this game for a few years (though my Steam account would say otherwise xD) and have come to love this game very much in doing so. It is a very large game, with tons of other players. You get a set list of servers to play on, and you do get a limit to how many characters you can have on your account.\\nCharacter creation&Basic Character Stuff:\\nThere is a vast horizon of options to choose from for your character's appearance. I have always found anything besides character height, race, and head/face options a bit unnecessary, since most of the time your armor (appearance and/or actual equipment) will cover it. But, it's still fun to give your character that tattoo that nobody will see, right? ;)\\nNames are also an interesting thing in this game, because once you reach a certain level, you can give your character a last name. I can't list too many games off the top of my head that will let you give your character a last name. There are also two different equipment tabs. One of them is the equpiment that you wear for the item bonuses such as stat boosters and whatnot. If you don't have any appearance equipment, the other equipment tab, then this is the gear you'll see. Appearance equipment is also another interesting aspect of this game; tons of players with different combinations of equipment in their appearance slots mean it's hard to find two players that look the same.\\nMounts are another wonderful aspect of this game. With tons of different mounts, there really is almost no limit to going places.\\nGameplay:\\nThe gameplay of this game is rather simple, in all reality. You get a ton of spells that you use, and the amount increases with progression through the game, and go into hotbars. A majority of combat in this game is, in most cases, just clicking of the icons in your hotbar. The animations for your spells aren't too impressive in themselves, unless your graphics are cranked up, however, don't let this deter you.\\nThe story for each character class is fairly different, being that in the end, each character begins on a story to get their epic weapon, the weapon for each class that will become their signature (though often, becomes replaced in-game due to stats not being impressive enough) weapon of choice. Each expansion adds to the story, too, that goes beyond your epic weapon. Even if you aren't paying attention to the stories you get into in too great detail, this game is just fun to play.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Bioshock 2 is viewed as the black sheep of the \"Shock\" franchise, created as a cheap cash-in sequel by a different development team that crafted the first Bioshock.  But beyond the initial impressions from fans and critics lies a very competent game, that in some spots actually outshines the original.\\n-The story is just as good, if not better, than the original.  Most people disliked the story because it didn\\'t add much depth to the mythos of Rapture, but the story in Bioshock 2 is much more personal and is more about the citizens of Rapture than the city itself.\\n-The gameplay is vastly improved.  Plasmids and Guns are duel wielded, making combining them in combat much easier.\\n-Mechanics are streamlined, not simplified.  Gene tonics no longer have a type and can just be equipped, assuming you have the slots.  Hacking is now done in real time on a simplified  mini-game.  Even the research mechanic is reworked to use a video-camera that gives you more research points depending on how well you combo your plasmids/weapons.  There are also new weapons and plasmids that are fun to use and don\\'t feel gimmicky.\\n-The art design is top notch.  The level designers have fun showing what rapture would look like with 10 more years of rust and decay.\\n-More moral decisions beyond \"Save/Kill Little Sister\".  The game also uses your decisions to inform the last act of the game and the ending.\\n-Final \"boss\" fight is much better than the one in the first game.\\n-The first hour of the game stinks. Period.  After you get into the first real level, the game begins to open up and let you start having fun.\\n-Some of the new characters have to be hand waved into existence, especially since they were supposed to be around before the first game but are clearly never mentioned in the first game.\\n-Levels are much more linear and not as large as in the first game. There are few sidepaths, but mostly you\\'ll be running from point A to B without backtracking.\\n-There are a few new enemies but I would have liked more enemy variety.\\n-You can use little sisters to gather Adam, but you have to protect them as they do it.  Most people hated the escort mission from the first game, so it\\'s something to be aware of.   I personally enjoyed this part of the game due to the multitude of alternate amunition that makes setting up traps fun.\\n-It\\'s clear that there were some significant rewrites late in development, some characters introduced at the start of the game are simply left out of the rest of the game\\'s plot.\\n-The FoV is very low and requires ini-rebinding to reset it every time you launch the game.  The problem is going into ironsights also resets the FoV, making you have to press your bound key to reset your FoV every time.\\n-Occasional issues with audio cutting out if there were too many sounds are playing at once.\\n\\nIgnore people saying the game is a cheap cash in: the gameplay is better and arguably so is the story.  Although there are fewer levels than in the original, the game actually took me more hours to beat than the first game: around 14 hours.  It’s also interesting that a lot of the story beats and themes end up being used in Bioshock Infinite (although I’m sure Ken Levine hates to admit it).\\nMinerva\\'s Den is also an excellent add-on to the base game, and lasts around 3 hours.  I\\'d recommend playing through Bioshock 2 on hard mode if you\\'ve played many shooters before, the difficulty curve stays pretty good throughout the entire base game.  Minerva\\'s Den is a bit harder on the same difficulty however, so keep that in mind.',\n",

       "  'text': \"This game was buggy but tons of fun when it first released into Early Release... The nights were filled with danger and DARK forcing players to hudle around Campfires for the 5 or 10 minutes that it was night and talk and get to know each other. There was no World wide chat even for Guilds so you were forced to communicate in person to find out about the wars and adventures down south since we had settled in the north. Because Nights were so dark trips down south felt like massive adventures. You had better hope there was a friendly Guild who had set up shop along your path that you could hangout with for the night. It wasn't uncommon to meet traders traveling around selling their wares and bringing news of some massive Guild Invasion they had just witnessed. Your surrounding Guilds were your community. Guilds watched out for each other and brought word of Raiding Parties that were entering the area. At that point it was time to mobilize your surrounding Guilds and start community patrols. The wars were huge and required knowing the game including the little bugs that you could take advantage of in order to get the upper hand... Some wars even required a little Environmental Terrorism to finally win.\\nThose were the fun days though. With the official release of the game however there is no fun to be had. The charm of the game has been lost. This release brought many changes alot possitive and my guild was really excited when we first got in and started seeing the changes... Then came the warden tree and the small ugly bases it now forces. All Creative freedom the game once had has now been elimenated in it's place boxes or diamonds are forced on everyone. That would have been ok if you got a decent number of additional walls with each Tree upgrade. However your stuck with 5 additional walls with each upgrade. The Upgrades are time consuming and expensive even for the largest of guilds. Taking days just to find the materials you need and then the 10 Silver for the first upgrade. All this work for 5 additional walls which isn't even to construct an airlock on your base. Base defenses aren't much better... You get 2 Watch Towers with the intial Warden Tree and then an additional Watch tower with every upgrade. Won't do much against a full on assault...\\nAs much as I love this game and have had so much fun in it prior to this release I can't possible recommend this game in the condition it's currently in. Really sucks because this was the developer's final chance to have this game succeed. RIP Tree of Life! It's been fun!\",\n",

I get the nostalgia aspect, but the odd reality is that I cherish the memory of playing those old school games more than I actually enjoy playing them today. When I do play them, it's an immediate reminder of where games are today and how far along games have come and why products have advanced the way they have. While old school games were considered technically superior in their time, they are considered technically inferior today. In fact, most games of yesteryear made the most of the technology available to them. So designing a technically inferior product today, on purpose, is not that impressive to me.\\nMany great old school games are classified as abandonware and the ROMs and emulation software can be easily found to play them for whatever gaming system you cherished the most. Find them, play them, and try to enjoy them the same way you did 30 years ago. I've tried, but it's not the same.

       "  'text': 'I played this game when it was originally released back in 2001. I got Red Faction (RF) in a bundle years ago, but haven\\'t played it since way back then. Now that it\\'s 2017 I decided to play through it again and see if it held up to the nostalgia I once had. Unfortunately it did not.\\nPlease note: Screenshots in above game description do not represent actual in-game screens. These have been massively doctored. Also game was played with PureFaction a mod that allows you to play in widescreen. That\\'s why my playtime is so low. Actual playtime is probably closer to 8 or 9 hours and that completed the sp campaign.\\nOn to the review:\\nRed Faction is a game that came out in the wake of Half-Life. It breaths Half-Life. In fact, it almost feels like a mod more than an original game. Many of the weapons are taken from HL. Troops and scientist look eerily similar. There is a tram portion. There are ducts to move around in. There are big round tunnels with fans on the end. Halfway through the game they mention the soldiers are killing all the scientists.\\nAll these things were not a thing until HL which came out only 2 or 3 years prior to RF. This was something I did not even notice playing back in \\'01, but now it\\'s almost too obvious. Not to say a HL clone makes a game bad. It\\'s just shows it\\'s age and lack of creativity.\\nRF biggest selling point was that everything in the game was to be destructible. Unfortunately it\\'s not. Only some dirt is destructible, but not all dirt. I remembered how awesome it was to destroy a wall and dig a tunnel. Somehow that memory is skewed. You are not given a pickaxe or anything to dig with. You have explosives in minimal quantity. Destructible pieces are not highlighted. Sometimes you can break through stuff, but really the mechanic was not used more than once or twice in the game. You can blow up certain walls to find extra armor or ammo, but those times are limited and usually there\\'s 2 ways into said, \"secret,\" areas so you didn\\'t even need to blast anything anyway.\\nHowever, the above issues are just minor. Who really cares if it\\'s a HL clone or its biggest selling point was a farce as long as the game is fun right? Unfortunately... it\\'s not... and I hate to say that because I remember really having fun with this game 16 years ago. But by today\\'s standards, the game does not hold up very well. It\\'s not one that stood the test of time to be sure.\\nWeapon reloads are soooo sloooowwwww! It can take irl 5 to 15 seconds to reload and don\\'t expect to switch once the animation starts. Oh no! You just have to break from combat and take bullets or find cover. Melee is op for mobs and broken for you. There\\'s a baton in the game. When you select it there is a 10 second readying weapon animation that you have to endure before you can use it. Why would you ever ready melee that needs 10 sec before you can use it?!? However, the mobs run right at you and hit constantly until you kill them. They run faster than you; so you can\\'t try to outrun. Imagine going through a 15 sec reload animation, while attempting to kite, but getting non-stop meleed the entire time.\\nGuns on the other hand are an entirely different level of frustration. There is no mouse smoothing; so I personally had jittery aim. It\\'s not a problem in other games, but it could be something to do with my mouse: Logitech G502. I\\'ll give them that. But the mobs dart back and forth so quickly you can\\'t ever get a good shot. I wasted more ammo on walls than enemies. Also, enemies are bullet sponges, taking multiple shots before dying. It\\'s massively frustrating to constantly miss shots because of enemies darting around and a jittery mouse. On the other hand, this could have something to do with PureFaction, the mod I used to play this game in 1080p. I don\\'t remember it being so difficult to shot people, then again 2001 was a different time for games.\\nThe cut scenes in this game should be turned into memes. It\\'s beyond campy. It turns hilarious because it\\'s so bad. It\\'s like watching Trolls 2 for the first time all over again. This game is worth a play through just to watch the cut scenes I swear!\\nBut overall this game just fails in everything. It fails in destructible environments (YOU HAD ONE JOB) it fails at a decent story, and it fails at smooth \\'n fun FPS action. I definitely do not recommend.',\n",

       "  'text': 'This game is now officially my \"biggest positive surprise of 2016\" (and yes, I know it\\'s older than that, but that\\'s when I played it, so gimme a break!)\\nPremise: I freakin\\' loved Lost Planet 2 for it\\'s co-op gameplay and silly, wacky action nonsense. It was the best sort of japanese couch co-op gameplay I can imagine. Thus, when I heard that LP3 was single player only, I was really, really sceptical of the game and put off playing it for a long time.\\nI was wrong to do so.\\nWhile LP3 does not tickle the same nerves as LP2 did, it\\'s a damn fine game! The story, full of interesting and well written characters, with a diverse cast of high quality voice actors that can really drive home the mentality of each person, was surprisingly well in line with that of the past games. Heck, a couple of times I found myself really sympathizing with some of the characters, which is rare for me.\\nAs for the gameplay, LP3 is a three-prong affair. You have small segments of just walking around, listening to people, upgrading yourself (though many upgrades felt like fairly pointless fluff to be honest, sort of tacked on to check some boxes, but it\\'s not really off-putting). Then there\\'s the parts, about half of the game, where you run about, gunning down Akrid (the insectoid enemies of the game) and uncovering the rest of the game\\'s story.\\nThen there\\'s the RIG, your very own mech that you get to stomp around in. It\\'s clunky, it\\'s slow, but it\\'s got personality to it. You get to listen to some surprisingly fitting tunes, get a new perspective on your surroundings and the walker even acts as a sort of base of operations when fighting enemies, providing you with your minimap and other info.\\nHowever, this mechanic, like a few others (such as the upgrading) isn\\'t really used all that much in the actual gameplay, for which I have to dock some points. Another thing I have to dock points for is the simplicity of most of the combat. The enemy patters are quickly learned and once this is done, many of the fights that are intended to be difficult turn into grenade-spamming, dodge-rolling repetition. Fortunately this also means you can breeze through most fights quite quickly once this stage sets in.\\nVisually speaking the game is a bog stanrad Unreal 3 -affair with some uncommonly good face capture in it. It\\'s pretty, and the visual style of the game is cool for the most part. Especially the RIG is a damn cool machine, and I have to also give a few bonus points for keeping the style well in line with the past games as well!\\nIn the end, with a solid story, gorgeous vistas, and mostly entertaining gameplay, I found myself positively surprised and actually quite hooked on LP3. With that, I give it a warm recommendation and a thumbs up.\\nPlaytime: 10+ hours (single playthrough)\\nRatings (1-10)\\nVisual: 8\\nAudio: 9\\nStory: 8\\nGameplay: 7\\nOverall: 9',\n",

Those who are looking at reviews of all 3 games, my recommendation is to get 1 and 3 and skip 2. Anyways on with the review. The level design and story pacing is good. The lore is connected to the 1st game so if you have played it and enjoyed learning the lore, a lot of the knowledge crosses over and makes 3 even more enjoyable from a lore standpoint. Each fight was designed well except for a couple but that didnt take away from the overall game. (no more body flinging ragdoll, i really miss that) combat is spot on like always, though PvP could use some changes because of the way connection to hosts/servers work. A highly recommended game for those who are avid soul game players and those who like a challange just like the other soul games. And also recommended to those looking to get into the souls series though i would suggest starting out on the 1st game if you care about lore.\",\n",

The enemies are all nazi's so if you are jewish you should really get your money's worth out of this. The nazi mind controlled dogs are wicked and the big♥♥♥♥♥nazi robot death machines are awesome. You can sneak up behind guys and knife kill them or blow your way through them with rifles, shotguns, and so on, even a sweet version of the rail gun. The level design is great: levels are a lot of fun to navigate and fight your way through. However once you've played the game there isn't much reason to play through again because it is what it is. But the one trip you take is a really fun ride. I am enjoying cranking up my 5.1 surround system and mowing down enemies like a whirlwind of pain. The game is made really well despite some slight performance issues. I have to turn off in-game vsync because it causes horrible stuttering and force it through nvidia control panel then the game runs smooth.\\nThe graphics are great and the sound is very good. The music is fitting and the game flows well in terms of both gameplay and story. The game is completely badass in every way. Dual wielding assault rifles and blowing away everything in sight never gets old.\\nOverall 8/10\",\n",

You're forced to use whatever equipment they give you. You're also given currency to buy consumerable equipment if you're having a rough time. The levels are small and can take a about 10 minutes at most to beat each one.\\nThe bad parts? Unfortunately, it doesn't feel like Halo. This is Halo lite. Enemies are dumb, and the maps are incredibly tiny. (Some maps are less than 3-4 screens!) It doesn't feel epic like the FPS Halo games.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"This game reminded me of playing smash bros on my wii when I was little, yea i know I didnt play the original smash bros, but I still loved the game. I like this game better though, in my perspective I am not a child anymore and feel like all nintendo games are for children, lol. This game is like the adult game of smash bros, or a 2D version with its own cool characters, combos, and weapons.\\nI discovered this game by seeing a friend play it and decided to download it and give it a try. I wasn't hooked onto this game right off the bat, but later on I got another friend to download it and we started playing 2v2 ranked and just had an absolute blast.\\nPROS:\\n- Smash Bros CLONE ON PC!!!!\\n- NON-TOXIC COMMUNITY at the moment because the game's community is still small and growing\\n- MATCHES ARE FAST if you verse button smashing noobs, but is still pretty quick like sub 5 min\\n- GAME IS FREAKIN FREE\\n- YOU CAN PURCHASE all the characters by just getting in game coins\\n- CUSTOM ROOMS to test stuff or just fight with randoms or friends\\n- PRACTICE modes to just get better and practice combos\\nCONS:\\n- Can only purchase the GOOD looking skins which pretty much include all the skins with real life money. NOT IN GAME GOLD.\\n- A lot of the characters moves  are similar, with an exception to some, but can have different graphical animations to go along with them. For example the katar dives, hammer down smash.\\n- There is not much to do with all your gold if you already have all the characters, unless you wait for a holiday event (the current holiday summer event is not really that good all you can really buy is orange skins for all the characters , not a lot of creativity) and all the cool stuff is payed with real life money.\\nI really enjoy this game and understand that it needs money to improve, I purchased the character pack instead of buying them with in game gold, because I wanted to support this free game. Mainly because it is one of the rare enjoyable free games. Other than that I do not feel an obligation to buy skins or in-game items because it's just not worth it to purchase a digital item which has no real life value, that is my opinion. Therefore, I would say that my major con is the lack of cool or unique items to purchase in-game with gold coins. My pro's are the FANTASTIC community and the competitivness that I look for in games. If I would rate this out of 10 I would give it a 7.9/10 because it is a good game but is not on its prime level in popularity as well as still being on the way to perfection. Anyway, GO GET THIS GAME CUZ IT'S FREE AND FUN.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Shadow Warrior Classic Redux is a 2013 remaster or update of an original Shadow Warrior game that came out in 1997, used Build engine and was made by 3D Realms. Or \"Lo Wang is Shadow Warrior\" if we are to belive what cover of a box said. It\\'s an old-school FPS game and can be descriped as eastern bro of Duke Nukem 3D.\\nClassic Redux also includes original DOS version, as well as all two released expansion packs, which are freeware anyway. There is no multiplayer from original. Original had competetive (DM) and cooperative modes, though it uses service which isn\\'t there anymore, so you can\\'t use original. Or at least as far as I am aware.\\nAs for technical side, there are occasional crashes. They can happen randomly, but mostly when I rushed with katana and would get blown up. Anyway, save often!\\nA more serious issue with this release got to be circular ground mines in Twin Dragon expansion. In original they would lay on ground, emitting a beeping sound like sticky bombs. When you come close to them, they will first rise into ground and then explode hard after few seconds, so you have to get into range to activate it and then run away. Sadly, mines are glitched in Classic Redux, they are actually sank into ground, so you can\\'t see them, but painful explosion still happens over ground. If you hear bomb beeping nearby - save and get ready to do some blind work.\\nThe setting is awesome, while plot is non-existant. You are Lo Wang, an asian pervy old fart, who is Shadow Warrior by the way. Which makes you think that he is a stealth master, but in reality he likes nuclear weapons. He worked for Master Zilla as a bodyguard, until Lo finds out that Zilla\\'s corporations goes as low as using demons to do dirty work, and his code of honor does not approve that. Zilla doesn\\'t want some Wang this way either.\\nSo you go around in either villages, temples or even cities and wreck mutants and monsters up. While meeting anime girls randomly. Hm, just like tentacled womans in Duke Nukem 3D, but most of them think that Lo Wang should just go away. They should have released a collab FPS title so we could get tentacled anime babes.\\nThe game is a lot like Duke Nukem, though it doesn\\'t have as much of city levels. But they are still gimmicky and overdetailed. Like, you can play Panchinko machines. Kinda. Or punch training equpment to regenerate your health without limit like a Shadow Casual. One liners are still funny, though \"ancient Chinese secret\" pops up too much. There are more cool stuff in it too, like more useful items that include \"grenades\", though only Gas one is for throwing. Some weapons have few modes which you can change with alt-fire. You can even use occasional vehicle, even though they are rare and kinda suck and have horrible collision.\\nActually, when I played this last time seriously times ago, I didn\\'t like it so much. It wasn\\'t fun, it seemed like game had too much punishing hitscan. Now I beat this game and had no issue for some reason, it was enjoyable a lot. Strange. Maybe that\\'s because before that I played on Hard (3th skill), while now I played on Normal (2nd skill), maybe the gap between these two is huge. Then again, hard hitscan enemies are always awful idea. Or maybe the mouselook and WASD of Classic Redux made it easier than doing it on keyboard-only of original DOS. Or maybe I just learned that some 90s FPS aren\\'t as awesome as Doom and you have to often retreat and use indirect ways to fight, instead of circle-strafing into every encounter. And if you ever meet Shadow ninja, then you are supposed to immeditly retreat, unless you want to get one-hit-killed.\\nI mean, you got a Grenade Launcher in this game. In other FPS it\\'s like Rocket Launcher but worse, with arcing grenades. You usually can hit things around corner only if you measure accurately and usually you are just a fool when you can just shoot into face. Not in Shadow Warrior! This bloody thing here has a freaking nuclear radius of explosions. What it means is that it\\'s actually useful to clean rooms around corners, while you don\\'t want to use it to fight face-to-face, as it\\'s weaker than rocket and easily hits you too. Actually, it might be way too good, ammo could be less common.\\nI really suggest you to check out Steam Guide of Quick Tips by Joseph Hicks, it really is a good one.\\nAnd yea, there are also some strange balance and choices, like railgun doesn\\'t have much use and it annoyes me that it shoots misaligned compared to crosshair. Katana is a fun melee weapon that at least instakills most common ninjas. You still look like a fool when swinging it over tougher enemies. Hmmmm, this game would have been better if it had cheesy colorful human ninjas from American stuff instead of mutant-ninjas.\\nAs for Classic Redux, well, this update comes with some cool stuff, mostly modern controls, widescreen support, renderer and Steam Integration so you can just use Steam Workshop! If you don\\'t like it, DOSBox-supported original is also included.\\nIt has a bunch of interesting stuff done in it. Main theme was remixed, though I prefer original. Weapon graphics were tweaked a bit so it doesn\\'t look weird on widescreen, like katana was made longer by looping parts of it. It sure looks better!\\nYou can even change if you want shurikens or darts graphics for the second weapon you have. That\\'s because the British version of original game was censored and had darts instead. I would say that darts make more sense in this case as the weapon feels very weak. Well, aside from part where they ricochet off walls. Don\\'t tell me about \"it\\'s not bad weapon as you can recover them off walls\", the game has problems with vertically when it comes to \"use\" action, so it\\'s weird and hard to get them all back.\\nSadly, some cheats don\\'t work. Mostly level select one. Aw.\\nAs you expect, like all full versions of a game, it comes with two episodes: Shareware episode \"Enter The Wang\" made of 4 levels and Full-Game-only \"Code of Honor\" made of around 18 levels. Shareware episodes uses full version\\'s CD Music instead of MIDI, but the only thing you miss is that one track sounded like nothing in registered version. Heh, you can notice how those Shareware levels were much better than Registered ones. Some probably were dissapoint after purchasing game. First half of Code of Honor isn\\'t particulary hot.\\nIt also comes with both expansion pack. Both were released for free due to being kinda considered abandoned by that time. Or just too late for party. They were being developed by other companies and publisher didn\\'t feel like investing more, or something.\\nTwin Dragon was released in 1997. It kinda had half good levels like Lo Wang\\'s house and fish village, and half of generic levels, like those sewer mazes. Some guess that it wasn\\'t complete release, as there is no new soundtrack like promised. Also, final boss, who is reskin, spamming \"there can be only one\".\\nWanton Destruction was found in 2005. It\\'s really all good stuff, it even reskinned most enemies into humans. Recommended, mhm.\\nThey say that they found materials of Deadly Kiss, the third expansion out of three, that was considered being lost. Maybe we will get it some day.\\nAnd heck, at least this game has awesome boss fight music, unlike Duke Nukem 3D who is a sissy. And Lo Want no sissy! Most of arcade or old gamers know that this is the most important element of any game.\\nIn the end, outside of some glitches which aren\\'t ruining whole game, it\\'s a pretty good redux of a decent game. Pretty fun. At least on Normal, since it abuses hitscan a bit too much at times for 90s shooter. Even though it didn\\'t bring multiplayer, but these are single-player focused games after all, multiplayer was just for fooling around. Big levels full of secrets ahead!',\n",

It is certainly a twist from your usual VN.\\nThe art and music were also nice and created a strong atmosphere within the game play.

       "  'text': 'Atom Zombie Smasher is a super little indie strategy game.  The basic premise is that you take on the guise of a commander holding back the zombie hordes from overruning your city.\\nIt works on two levels; first is the strategy where a map of the city districts is where you see the progress of zombie infestations and plan your next mission.  You can choose which military assets you take with you from: infantry, snipers, mines, demolitions, barricades, gas attracting teams or artillery.  Once you initiate the mission, the game changes to a tactical sub-game where you place your units on the map to best protect the civilians you are trying to extract from the map, while avoiding collateral damage.  To many dead civilians and you fail.\\nThere are a number of tactical elements that affect each mission type such as: map layout, dangerous area which can explode if you are not careful, more or less time-limit & available/unavailable units.\\nYou win if you extract a minimum number of civilians or your units are able to destroy the encroaching zed hordes.  However if you do not clear the map of zeds before nightfall more zeds arrive to swarm the map.  Successful missions reward you with points that go towards an overall victory target.  Units also receive XP to increase their unique zed destroying abilities and they can level up to increase those abilites to make them more clincial.\\nThe zeds then receive strategic points allocated to some city district (1-4) which determines the strength of the zombie hordes and the difficulty of initiating a mission there.  This continues until you reach the campaign victory target.\\nThough gameplay is fairly repetitive the addition of custom campaign options make the strategy and tactical aspects that much more varied.  Scientists can be found wondering the city area and can be rescued.  Each one can then be \"spent\" to acquire research upgrades towards 8 specific areas of interest including: faster xp gains for units, faster strategic weapons, resilient scientist, more destructive weapons etc).  You can have access to strategic and tactical weapons that can clear zeds from an entire district thus reseting the danger level there.  Just be aware of the monster-zeds! lol\\nFor me this was a surprise gem of a game.  While graphics are just basic sprites, it really can grab you if you let it.  It one of the most intelligently designed games Ive ever played and almost perfectly balanced.  While the musical score and audio is fairly basic, they do a wonderful job of immersing you in unfolding events.  Best of all its a very polished game.   Even if some Mac users are having problems with playing it.\\nIf you are after a basic but enjoyable zombie apocalypse survival simulator then you should pick up a copy when the price is right for you!',\n",

As soon as you get into a game there is at least one spammer, and the game makes it impossible to beat spamming. At least 90% of my games have been a whole bunch of people using the same, super OP ability again and again. You cannot punish or beat the spammers, without doing the exact same thing and hoping for the best. In addition to this, the dodge system is a bit broken. If you dodge, someone can just use a long combo on you and you can't get out. You are beaten to the edge of the map, unable to do anything. There are a few characters who are unbeatable, and others who require any level of skill are immediately shutdown and K.O.ed constantly. Also, there is no tutorial. I've been playing the game for a while and I'll admit that I still dont know most of the controls or combos. There are many moves that are not taught, and to learn them you have to go online. No game should force the user to learn how to play it on a website, making it hard to practice and understand why they never win.\",\n",

This got me hooked on what was to come, but the journey ahead that I received did not live up to this expectation. I can happily recommend this game for its idea and trying to run with it, but unfortunately there are a few factors that limit this recommendation to only getting this game if it is on sale ($5 or less, in my personal opinion).\\nFirst of all, the visuals are great. The sounds (gunshots, music, voice-acting, etc.) were fine too. However, certain character animations and the almost genre-standard \\'invisible barriers\\' made it hard for me to immerse myself into the game.\\nThen again, I feel like it\\'s not the type of game that needs you to be immersed in. The story is decent and the gunplay itself is fine, so apart from a few minor things that I disliked, overall the game is okay. I felt that it was too short (clocking in at just over 3 hours for me), and after the opening of the game, the \"shock-factor\" of the invasion rubbed off. But in the end I played it for a bit of fun, and that\\'s what I got :)\\nSo if you\\'re okay with a short experience (the MP is very limited now due to the game\\'s age) and a few minor technical issues that can be looked past, then maybe you\\'ll be okay with this game. You should have some fun if you\\'re a fan of first-person shooters, but just don\\'t expect a compelling story that lasts for a good amount of time.\\nEnjoy :)',\n",

       "  'text': 'I just don\\'t know. I seem to have the free demo of the game. I\\'ve played the tutorial and the first actual mission. This is where I stand:\\n- No idea what the story behind Warmachine is. I have heard about the game, but that\\'s it. The campaign starts of weirdly and the dialogue is infurating in my opinion. That the characters are not animated when talking doesn\\'t help either. It\\'s been 10 years or so since I last saw 3D rendered characters who couldn\\'t move their mouths. If you don\\'t want to animate that, fine, it\\'s a strategy game, I get that, but zooming into their faces during every cutscene is a moronic idea then. Also the campaign is extremely boring so far. The dialogue, the characters, the \"humour\". It just feels off and not interesting at all.\\n- The gameplay. It seems to have depth, I\\'ll give them that. Your units are different enough at the start at least. Warjacks look awesome and have a ridiculous miss rate of 40% in melee vs basic infantry. Seriously? I was a bit underwhelmed. The pacing is wrong here. After introducing the warcaster as your hero unit and then almost immediately afterwards giving you your first warjack I\\'ve gotta say that that thing is just a big bullet sponge right now...kinda sad. Navigating the attacks and spells etc. is more or less intuitive. They have included tooltips why an action is not possible, which is cool. Unfortunately those tooltips are only available for some actions. Why? God only knows.\\n- The controls. They are not that great. The whole game feels sluggish and partially unresponsive. At times you don\\'t know why you can\\'t commit an action...example in mission 1: You need to shoot at barrels with your warcaster. Well, ok. You select that woman, move her into position, click on the ranged attack button and the attack automatically lights up. Cool, works. You can also click on the barrels to shoot them just like with any other enemy - in theory. In reality when I got to the second set of barrels I could not ♥♥♥♥ing select to shoot them. I had free LoS, no enemies near me, yet I could not select to shoot the barrels. I realized a turn later that there are small next/previous buttons for enemy selection as well. Cycling through those I eventually got the barrels selected as my target. But why? Why make this such an effort?\\nI think you can get used to that, though.\\n- The camera. Oh my god the camera. People were, unfortunately, right about that ♥♥♥♥ing camera. I messed around a bit with the camera options, but none of the settings are satisfactory. Moving the camera is sluggish as hell (thank god I disabled motion blur...yes this game has motion blur, for whatever reason) and unprecise. You can move, rotate, zoom...blabla, but it doesn\\'t feel natural, especially in free camera mode. Since it is a turn based game I can also kind of live with that. What I can\\'t live with is the combat camera. I have disabled action camera, but as soon as the AI makes their move, the camera goes bonkers. Example: An enemy unit is selected, the camera jumps to that unit, the unit movies, the unit stops. The camera jumps BACK to your previously selected unit, then back again to the enemy unit as it makes its attack. It does this all the time. It literally makes me feel sick. Sometimes the camera just doesn\\'t scrolls to the edge of the screen during such a move and then back again. Why? Why can\\'t you just focus the camera on the unit that moves, but not actually follow the unit, but just show the area in which the move is being executed? The simple following every unit at closest zoom (yes it does that as well, zooming ♥♥♥♥ing in every time) makes my head spin...again. The camera is a mess.\\n- The graphics. They\\'re serviceable. They look good, but something feels off. It\\'s all too blurry somehow. Even the written dialogue text is blurry. It looks cheap. The actual assets look good, but as a whole it\\'s not quite there. Landscapes are ok, but they also could have done a better job with the UI highlighting actual units - friendly and enemy. At times they just meld with the landscape...pretty annoying.\\n- Price: A 30 euro price tag for a kickstarter funded game is quite a lot. I\\'m not sure how much you get for that. I think 4 factions in MP and the campaign, the boring campaign with 20 missions. You will, however, only play the annoying red head afaik...boring, boring, boring. I guess they may do other campaigns for other factions, but at this point I\\'m not even sure they should. Additionally they want to charge you for upcoming content as well, of course. DLC, yay. Right now that is the \"Retribution\" faction bundle for skirmish and MP for whopping 15 euros and the \"mercenaries faction\". I think they are a faction, sold either as individual units or via 3 bundles for a total or 20 euros! I think you can use them to supplement any army...being mercenaries and all. I get it: You want to make money\\nBUT! If you fund your game through kickstarter for almost 600,000 dollars (+ whatever additional funds you received), then proceed to sell the base game for 30 dollars with only 4 of the 6 (or 7) factions of the actual tabletop game, and THEN proceed to sell those same factions for another 35 dollars, while at the same time your game is full of bugs and needs to be improved in almost every aspect, I think you don\\'t deserve my money at all. That is the deciding factor why I choose to rate this game negatively. A lot of things can be fixed or improved, but the pricing is a hit in your face. Not to mention that there will most likely either be more DLC or that\\'s it...it\\'s not worth it imho. If you\\'re a Warmachine fan, chances are you\\'re gonna play the tabletop anyway.',\n",

Watching the boy running around the same terrain while doing the old trial-and-error kills patience very fast, especially if you have already figured out how you're supposed to get through, whether by yourself or through reading a guide, but is held back by the controls.

       "  'text': 'AT A GLANCE\\n(Full review follows below)\\nGame Name: Max Payne 3\\nOriginal Release: 2012\\nGenre Tags: Third-Person Shooter; Atmospheric; Story-Rich; Cinematic; Noir; Adult\\nMy Overall Grade: A+\\nEstimated Playtime (Campaign): 15-30 hours\\nMultiplayer Aspect: Auxiliary\\nRecommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Fans of the intellectual property; Aesthetes; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseurs\\nREVIEW\\nMax Payne 3 is an outstanding action-shooter that offers a strong narrative and a highly cinematic experience. If you are someone who wants raw action, and doesn’t want to see a lot of cutscenes or kill-cams: then you may not enjoy this. However, if you are someone who enjoys games that play like movies, this is something you must play. In my opinion, Max Payne 3 is one of the best cinematographic-action games ever made and likely will be for a long time.\\nThe first aspect I will highlight in defense of my opinion is the writing and dialogue. Max Payne 3 easily has some of the best writing I have ever encountered in a video game. The overall narrative is interesting and entertaining, but the real beauty of the writing shines through in the dialogue. There are several lines throughout the game that will evoke that inner-thought of: “that was a good one.” And the excellent voice acting ices the cake to ensure the cutscenes have an A-one quality that rivals Hollywood movies.\\nBesides the main cutscenes that give life to the actual narrative, there are also many other cinematic features woven deep into the gameplay mechanics. You can activate Bullet Time® and Shootdodge™ as you play through the fight scenes in each level; doing so will slow time and allow you to perform elaborate kill sequences. Further, bullet-cams and kill-cams will pop up periodically to show some nasty kills. There are also level-specific “special” kills that will slow time and create cinematic opportunities.\\nThe fight scenes encompass the vast majority of the actual gameplay of Max Payne 3. The game is very linear and generally ushers you from one shootout to the next, with a cutscene in between to show more plot development. There are some secret areas and collectibles, but generally the areas where you are in control are rather small and undeviating. However, this is perfectly aligned with the movielike feel of the game; and the levels are well-designed and diverse, so they never feel boring or plain.\\nThe whole experience is brought together nicely by solid graphics and animations, a high level of attention to detail, and advanced physics and particle effects.\\nNow, Max Payne 3 is the third installment in the franchise. It is technically a direct sequel, although it feels a bit more like a spiritual successor. You can easily enjoy this game without having played the first two. (Of course, it is still best to learn what happened in the story during the previous games). Also the first two installments in the Max Payne franchise were created by different people than this one. This game does go in a bit of a different direction compared to the earlier installments. For example, it isn’t quite as dark and noir; and also eases a bit on the deep, psychological inner-war concept. These, and other differences, upset some fans of the franchise (as seems to be a common theme in new installments of long-standing franchises). So be aware of this. I personally feel that all three games can be appreciated for what they are.\\nArcade-mode, timed-mode, higher difficulties, and achievements all contribute to the possibility of many gameplay hours. There is also a multiplayer mode that is pretty fun. During the time I played, there was a decent amount of people who played regularly; although there were times I couldn’t find a game. I actually liked the multiplayer a lot and played it for dozens of hours, but I will admit that most people will probably find it lackluster.\\nIn summary, I highly recommend Max Payne 3 to anyone who would enjoy a heavily cinematic action-shooter and who would appreciate the amazing writing. It is one of the best “plays-like-a-movie” games ever made. Having said that, I can understand some of you just want action. If you want pure gameplay and/or generally skip cutscenes in games, you definitely should look elsewhere for your next shooter.',\n",

With splendid sound, fluid animations, intense gameplay and superb online there is nowhere to go wrong with this game. Based in the World War 2 era CoH:ToV is based around 4 factions; the Americans, the British, the Panzer Elite and the Wehrmacht. All campaigns from the three games are on the Tales of Valor main menu so there is no need to start the seperate ones up and also you can play with anyone regardless if they only have CoH or if they have all 3.

While most of the newly arrived were Americans, the Gold Rush attracted tens of thousands from Latin America, Europe, Australia, and eventually China. At first, the prospectors retrieved the gold from streams and riverbeds using simple techniques, such as panning. More sophisticated methods of gold recovery were developed and later adopted around the world. At its peak, technological advances reached a point where significant financing was required, increasing the proportion of gold companies to individual miners. Gold worth tens of billions of today\\'s dollars was recovered, which led to great wealth for a few. However, many returned home with little more than they had started with.\"\\n\\nthis is 49er fever in effect... thievin and murderin for gold in them thar hills!!!',\n",

       "  'text': 'Contrast is a game that seems like it should be amazing, based purely on the premise, mechanics, and art direction alone. And while I do still recommend it (to a point), the final package ended up being a tad underwhelming. But let\\'s start at he beginning. There is a lot of good to the game, specifically the elements I just mentioned. The setting (early 20th century Paris) and art direction are very interesting, and there are lots of cool things to see throughout the journey. You play as Dawn, the acrobat \"imaginary friend\" of a young girl named Didi. The game revolves around Dawn\\'s ability to transform from a 3D person into a 2D shadow. As a shadow, you can maneuver along any other shadow, as if it were a normal platform. Puzzles generally involve manipulating light sources to create navigable shadows, and then platforming your way through those shadows to reach new areas. The story, without revealing much, is just OK. It involves Didi\\'s lounge-singer mother, her loser father, and a mysterious magician named Vincenzo. There\\'s nothing wrong with the story, but it\\'s also nothing mind-blowing, for the most part. And that sort of sums up the game as a whole - merely adequate. The main gameplay hook of transforming into a shadow, while cool, just isn\\'t enough to sustain a whole game in its own. Don\\'t get me wrong, there are plenty of neat segments and cool applications of the idea. But after a while, you\\'ll start to get the feeling of \"been there done that\", only in a new location. Not to mention, most of the puzzles (such as they are) are very simple anyways, there\\'s not all that much meat on the bone in terms of challenge or completely fresh ideas. I am not sure they even could have added anything more to improve the game. As I said, it\\'s perfectly adequate as-is, and definitely doesn\\'t overstay its welcome. I just have this nagging feeling that there were missed opportunities for additional puzzles or ways the shadow mechanic could have been used. Maybe that\\'s unfair, but so be it. Despite all this, I actually did enjoy and have fun with the game overall. I just feel that maybe with a bit more development time, it could have been better. But what\\'s here is definitely an interesting experience, and worth checking out if the atmosphere or shadow mechanic intrigues you, as it did for me. The entire experience lasts around 5 hours or so, so also keep that in mind when considering your purchase. I would say hold off for a sale, unless you really feel the need to check it out right away.\\nMy only real complaints would be for technical issues. Specifically, the game lacks many of the customization settings one would expect in PC games, such as video options and the like. Personally, I had an issue with the lack of an option for x-axis inversion for the camera controls. And while there is still no solution patched directly in game (at least as of the time of this review), for the record, I wanted to note that the developers actually responded to my request within minutes and provided a configuration file fix that could be changed manually to implement that feature. While it wasn\\'t the ideal solution, I really appreciated their responsiveness, as it allowed me to play the game the way I wanted. So kudos to the developers for that. Which reminds me - I definitely recommend a gamepad for this one.',\n",

Start the game, and you select which you want to play from the main menu, so it’s all very neat and tidy. But apart from that, really, there seems little point in this edition. The changes id made are rather trivial. They made DOOM 3 scenes a little lighter, but less scary in the process.  Lets be honest, do we really care that we can now see the miles and miles of bland pipes that make up all the DOOM 3 backgrounds? They would have done better changing the sounds, which are rather bland. But anyway, is it worth it? If you already have the games, then no. There aren’t enough changes to even justify a sale price!

       "  'text': 'Ravenfield is, as of right now, a very simplistic FPS that perfectly encapsulates almost everything that people like about FPS games!\\nIt has fast paced action with custom loadouts, and you can have an unlimited number of enemies on either team (though you probably don\\'t want to go over 100 vs 100). Each map plays very differently from ther others, and this is what really stands out with Ravenfield: how unique everything is.\\nEach weapon is of a different \"class\" (assault, shotgun, sniper, etc.) meaning that they all perform differently, there are several distinct vehicles that you can ride in, and the secondary weapons/gear are all unique and perform their own role. There is also a whacky physics system in the game that can make you laugh from time to time, like if you shoot someone with a rocket at their feet, they\\'ll probably go flying off into the distance. You can also warp time and slow things down to get a better shot, or just to take in an epic moment, with the caps-lock key. I rarely use this, though, cause I tend to forget about it, and it feels kind of cheaty.\\nOn the other hand, there are currently only 4 maps, 3 finished, and 3 gamemodes, 2 finished. The campaign isn\\'t finished and the AI can be a pain at times.\\nThe biggest drawback for a lot of people is that there isn\\'t, and never will be, multiplayer. I feel like this is a really important point to stress, because everyone seems to want multiplayer to be in the game, and it has been explicitly stated by the developer over, and over, and over that there will not be any multiplayer in the game. This is a single player game, but a great one at that.\\nOverall I would recommend this game to everyone who likes FPS games. The first time I played this game I didn\\'t even realize that I was playing with bots until the second match, and I just love the simplicity of it all.\\nI also forgot to mention that you can pick up an earlier version of this game online for free if you want to try a demo before buying.',\n",

Taking the straight-faced absurdity of\\nto new heights, it was widely praised for its original typing-based gameplay.\\nNow another game in the series receives the\\ntreatment -\\n, leaning\\non the theme of trashy exploitation films.\\nThe result is a game that\\'s best enjoyed when you turn off your brain - but not all the way, because you still need your typing skills. *church organ plays horror theme*\\nYou type to dispatch enemies. I mean how fun is that? Every zomb- sorry,\\ncomes with a word or string of words you must type quickly and accurately, spraying them with bullets with every stroke of your keyboard. No need to aim, just start typing to select the enemy you want to target.\\nYou can also play the game in the regular\\nmode, aiming and shooting with the mouse. So this is really two games in one.\\nKeep your eyes peeled for powerups: slow-mo, health, and in HOTD mode, money for weapon purchases. There\\'s also upgrades and collectibles that unlock more menu songs, artwork and other extras.\\nYou know tongue in cheek parodies that go too far and become annoying? TOTD:OK is right on the edge of that, but manages to stay enjoyable. It helps that what it parodies is already something not completely serious: grindhouse and exploitation films.\\nYou play as a variety of characters such as straight-man Agent G, bombastic cop Isaac Washington, foul-mouthed badass Varla Guns, and clueless ditz Candi Stryper. You face off against such villains as Papa Caesar and Clement Darling. The names alone are enough to make you groan while grinning.\\nI haven\\'t yet had the chance to try the co-op, but I really want to! Yeah, it has two-player co-op. What I like is that both players can be typing the same word or phrase. Game doesn\\'t restrict you, and leaves it up to you to coordinate for efficiency.\\nExtended the words the game throws at you with official DLCs as well as user-made \"dictionaries\". (Check my own Trump-themed dictionary in my workshop.) You can download lots, toggle them on and off, choose what percentage of stock vs custom you want, random order, difficulty scaling etc. It\\'s well implemented.\\nNot many negatives to this game. I\\'d say most of them have to do with the enemy selection and targeting. It\\'s difficult sometimes to tell which enemy will reach you first. The game changes the border colour on the words, but it should be more prominent and react faster. In co-op, it\\'s also not prominent enough which player is targeting with enemy. Just some small arrows. What else… Backspace key is used to cancel your target and switch to another. But instinctively, I press backspace whenever I mistype in the game, even though it\\'s not needed. I wish Delete was the switch target key instead.\\nAll in all though, a great game, this. Funny, fun, and challenging, with plenty of replay value and features. Well worth the price, I think. It\\'s not a gimmick, it\\'s a full-fledged game. If you enjoy typing games and tackiness, this is the one for you.',\n",

       "  'text': '-UPDATED TO MOST RECENT 2015-\\nI still stand by my review below even though the game is officially released.  The game feels and plays like CS/ COD and I cannot stand that.  AA1.0 and AA2.0/SF was the best and will continue to be, this is just TERRIBLE.\\nBAD!\\nIt is BAD.\\nThey have done away with all the usual stuff and made it more CoD like..\\nThe original AA 2.8 and before that was the best and then AA 3 was okay.  Not amazing, but okay.\\nThen we have this one... It is BAD.  They have removed almost all the simulation stuff and it feels so bad.\\nIt feels like a cheap CoD game, and we all know CoD are cheap copy paste games.\\nThis ruined the games for me, and it is not good at all.\\nEven the character control is bad, the graphics are simple and basic and the audio at times is annoying because shooting makes sounds like a pea shooter.\\nAvoid at all grounds!\\nControls: The controls are pretty much the same, but with a faster pace making it feel more arcade style like COD or CS than the actual AA games.\\nAudio: The audio I find high annoying.  The guns sound nothing like a real gun or even close.  They often resemble a childrens potatoe gun firing, the footsteps sound like a boot running on solid wood ALL the time, the grenades like a clapping hand and so on, you get the idea.\\nGraphics: The graphics HAVE been updated since AA2.8 and below, they do make for a nice change but they are not any better and if anything at times annoying to look at I find. Unsure why but the graphics do not give it a good appeal and has a weird approach to certain things.\\nGameplay: The gameplay...The original AA was designed as a training and promotion to join the Army, this version feels like a copy of COD to just get people to play their game and has gone away from the more simulation aspect of the game and made it arcade run and gun.\\nI hope they change things in the future of the time I am writing this review, but so far as I write this.  I would avoid!',\n",

None of them, until this game.\\nKof 13 is a solid game overall. And the pc version is great now. It wasn't because I read about the problems it has on forums before buying it. I recommend this game to any type of fighting game player. They will find so much content in this game that they wont find those in any other game at this time. Unique gameplay; keeping the old KOF gameplay is great, no need to change that. The graphics, backgrounds, soundtracks are all great. They complete the game like in any other kof game.\\nI've played this game on PS3 for the first time. The online experience was so bad, I just couldn't enjoy it. I've played it for sometime then I put it aside. Before I buy the game on PC, I read that they improved the netcode while porting the game to PC. It is correct and they did a great job. Online gameplay is smooth. If you've played SF4 series on PC, you will find similar, even better online experience in this one.\\nGame includes a  new game mechanics to make you achieve crazy combos. When you get caught to that kind of combo, you are probably done with the round. Imo it is not a good thing, even it is hard to achieve that type of combo. You need experience and very good reflexes. I loved KOF because of it's unique gameplay and forces you to think before acting. I am not saying there shouldn' be any combos but not like this, like infinite ones.\\nAnyways overall it is a great game. If you are a dedicated, curious fighting player you will find a lot of content in this game.  And you will keep trying to master a character or a team. Where is Bluemary, Yashiro team !? And where is Shingo !? I want Shingo Yabuki !!!\",\n",

       "  'text': '\"It\\'s kind of pathetic: you get all erratic, about dirty dishes congesting the sink.\\nI\\'m tired of your bothers; remember our fathers, who dwelled in a world filled with rubbish and stink...\"\\nAnd so the story begins. Deponia is the tale of Rufus, the son of the man who founded Rufus\\'s hometown of Kuvaq and subsequently disappeared, and his attempts to escape the junk-strewn planet of Deponia. During one of his infamous \"perfect\" plans, he runs into a girl from the romanticized, junk-free world of Elysium, nearby.\\nThe two become wrapped in each other\\'s quests, for better or for worse. Rufus is stuck with Goal, because she\\'s his only ticket out of this dump, and Goal is stuck with Rufus because, well, she\\'s unconscious, and she doesn\\'t really have any say in the matter. Plus he\\'s the person with the closest thing to her best interests at heart, between the town of Kuvaq, who wish to keep her as a trophy resident, and the Organon who seemingly have their own agenda.\\nRufus is not the most selfless hero. In fact, he\\'s rather vain and self-centered. He manages to pull it off and remain endearing, however - at least to the audience. His neighbors in Kuvaq are painfully tired of his absent-minded and often quite dangerous (to Rufus, and everyone else in a several mile radius) plans and experiments. In a way, maybe I find Rufus endearing because he reminds me so much of, well, me. He\\'s lazy, but dreams big, and feels he deserves to be the one to make it simply because he wants it more.\\nDeponia\\'s a silly game, the kind where great bodily harm is often cartoonishly shrugged off when it\\'s not important to the plot. It made me laugh quite a few times, and most of the characters are well-written and well-voiced. The Organon bug me, with their loud, crackly, sort-of-digitized voices, but most of the others sound alright to downright enjoyable. The music is a perfect fit, evoking the rattling and banging of garbage, while still remaining pleasant to listen to. I\\'m quite fond of the bar theme in particular, to the point where I would sometimes stop in at the place even after I had no business left there, simply to listen for awhile. The world is beautifully drawn, and most importantly, interesting. There are surprises everywhere, and the world itself is rather unusual, and nicely characterized as you go about your journey.\\nThe puzzles are challenging, without ever seeming unfair. You do have kind of an unusual amount of \"gather cleaning supplies and clean this thing off\" puzzles, but then this IS a planet covered in discarded scrap and refuse, so it\\'s at least justified. On the whole, Deponia\\'s puzzles and style feel to me like a proper evolution of the classic Lucasarts SCUMM adventures. The sense of humor, however, is unique, and I love it. It really feels like Daedalic had fun writing and designing this game, and I\\'m glad, because I had fun playing it.\\nIt\\'s not the longest adventure game, but it\\'s long enough (I clocked about 11 hours of quality adventuring on my playthrough), and I absolutely cannot wait to play the next installment in the Deponia trilogy.\\nAnd that folk-singer narrator guy ruled!\\n\"HUZZAH, HE\\'S OFF NOW, GOODBYE!\"',\n",

Aside from the lore which I barely understand in a game that I\\'m told runs for at least 70 hours more, I know that I\\'m plunged into a world that is about to hit the fan and feces will start flying all around.\\nGameplay wise it resembles FFXIII (rather, FFXIII resembles this game) on the world map and in \"dungeons\" but that is not always bad. The real difference comes in the combat scenarios which are extremely more complicated and tactical than FFXIII ever was. You have several units (made from 1-5 soldiers) fighting various assortments of units at the same time, and you have to coordinate who attacks what and if you make up the wrong choice, you\\'ll have another unit intercept yours for a negative morale hit (morale is basically how well your forces think the battle is going. if it\\'s going good, they\\'ll do more damage, and vice versa)\\nStorywise, it\\'s what you expect from a Square(Enix, yuck) game. Extremely complex, lots of names to memorize at once, interesting cartography, etc.\\nTL;DR: Got this game on a sale. I\\'m at 10 hours and I bought it for like 5$. That\\'s a 2:1 ratio and I\\'m expecting 70 hours more of enjoyment. Good enjoyment at that. Do keep in mind that JRPGs are not things like Dragon Age, although you can keep a resemblance, you have to expect other things here.',\n",

The genre definitely deserves to be revived and Reakktor Studios seems to have put forth much effort to help the cause.

The graphics hold up very well for a six year old game.  I did run into a couple of bugs, but nothing bad or a simple reload didn\\'t fix.\\nThe game is labeled as survival horror.  This is not correct.  It\\'s action horror, simply because it is almost impossible to die unless you\\'re just bad at games.  By no stretch of the imagination is the game difficult, as it practically throws medpacks and boxes of ammunition at every available opportunity.\\nThis is, of course, not including the Time Manipulation Device and its various abilities.  With it, an otherwise average corridor shooter is spiced up with some simple time puzzles and incredibly overpowered battle mechanics.  It pretty much breaks the game, but it\\'s enough fun that you don\\'t really mind.\\nI didn\\'t play any multiplayer.  From what I understand, it was great, but dead seeing as how old it is.\\nThere are reasonably large upgrade systems for both the TMD and your guns.  Unfortunately, there is no NG+, which is kind of a bummer seeing as how there are technically four different endings.  From reading the other ones, I hesitate to call any of the endings \"good\", with the primary choice being kind of a letdown.

CD Projekt Red is the best development team to come along since Piranha Bytes and their introduction of the Gothic series. The Witcher series is proving to be every bit as rewarding. Its storylines are imaginative and epic on scales which rival major Hollywood fantasy movies such as The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. Its graphics are so brilliant that with each successive hour of play, the distinction between reality and fantasy becomes increasingly obscure. The combat is extremely challenging and exciting. Character development is complex but intuitive, and the immersion grows with every custom development. This game offers a good balance of linearity and nonlinearity. For virtually any RPG gamer, this game is unquestionably a must have. It offers an effortless attempt to lose oneself for hours or even days in an entertaining and thoroughly rewarding experience.',\n",

       "  'text': \"This game, VVVVVV, it calls itself. A mess of letters that blend together into a mess of jagged lines, as if to trace one's path through life in a retrospective essay of Adobe Flash and Steam winter sales. It infuriates me. But not for the reasons one might expect, no, not the usual cries of difficulty and despair.\\nI double-click the name in my Steam library and prepare for the worst. Forty nine cents, I say. This game cost me less than a round of slightly clogged arteries from the local fast food joint and was paid for entirely by selling virtual headwear and trading cards to those less fortunate than myself. Surely I will be able to find some modicum of enjoyment of this mess of Flash. Flash? Perhaps not! The forums of the Internet tell me that at one point it was remade in a proper programming language. As such, the game can suffer random slowdowns in fullscreen and neither the Steam overlay nor capture software such as Fraps will recognize the game. I found myself unable to take and upload screenshots of my trials in this pixelated, single-colored world, for all to see but none to comment on. A Google search leads to a Steam forum post regarding then-'soon' updates for overlays, achievements and the Cloud. The famous Cloud. At the original time of writing, this post dated from over two years ago. The Cloud has since been implemented to questionable effect, but now there are a host of colorful trinket achievements to chase. Did you already play the game to completion before their appearance? You're out of luck, friend, do it again, they say. Alt-tabbing the game will lock your cursor in the corner of your screen and sometimes just crash to desktop. This game was not built on Source, they tell me. They're lying to me.\\nThe game itself controls acceptably. Sometimes I find myself sliding off platforms and into hazards and sometimes getting stuck inside either. Platformers should not have slippery controls like this, but the air control is precise and exact. Why is there such a difference? Is there an underlying message to be found here, perhaps describing the trials of Man trapped in his earthly plane? I would hope not, as this game predates the trend of waves upon waves of lazy, 'deep' indie\\nby several years. To the untrained eye it appears to fit quite well, though, with the simplistic graphics and chiptune soundtrack.\\nThis. This is where this executable of poor optimization and developer laziness gets to me. The game's art style is obviously meant to harken back to an era of dial-up and diskettes, in truth even earlier than both. Simple graphics and single color palettes attempt to imitate the limitations of old, yet miss the mark entirely. The developers want you to think you're playing a Commodore 64 game, down to including an imitation tape deck load screen upon startup, and yet they so clearly miss the appeal of the C64. Why go for plain, blocky graphics when it was capable of so much more? Why use a soundtrack consisting entirely of generic chiptunes churned out in Fruityloops in an afternoon when the Commodore was famous for its SID chip, used even today for its unique sound and characteristics? This was perhaps the biggest indicator of Vee Six's origins.\\nVee Six? Yes, that will do. I feel it fits this game nicely. You wanted the big American V8 with more displacement than the total Coke bottles in a shopping cart at Wal-Mart, but instead went for the more frugal six-cylinder for better gas mileage. Perhaps it shows up under a different name, like Grand Sport or Touring, but the illusion disappears as soon as the hood is opened and the guts of the machine become visible. Likewise, you wanted a game that harkens back to the days of incredible difficulty, but without actually playing a game from that era, so you bought Vee Six.\\nIt was quite ahead of its time, really, this poor little game. Perhaps it actually started the trend of retro-throwback games that only appear as such to the untrained, Mountain Dew chugging eye, taking a small break from his endless stacks of semi-futuristic first person shooters starring Sgt. Master Sgt. Technician of Operations Captain Slabmeat and his sidekicks, Alpha Team Bravo Charlie Omega. I have doubts about his ability to find such a game, though. This seems like one meant for that other audience, the one that cuddles into their woolen hat at the corner coffee house while typing on their ridiculously overpriced, shining white laptop and adjusting their lensless, thick-framed glasses. A game for those who want to go back... but not really, because they never experienced what they would be going back to in the first place. An imitation that falls apart like that disgusting hipster's Volkswagen as it gets driven around a small upstate city in New York looking for guys in skinny jeans and no shoes while struggling from no oil changes to no oil changes.\\nSo. An interesting word, 'so.' Both a statement and a question. So what? So this is a review, after all. Reviews have to have one final word, else the whole page might as well be used as a paper airplane to send your thoughts and dreams. In these modern times of instant messaging and ironic tendencies, no one has time to read more than exactly one hundred forty-four characters without requesting a short-form so their attention deficit disorder-afflicted minds can process that one tidbit of information before riding the rollercoaster of latest trends down the next incline while that child in the back row vomits all over himself and the poor sod sitting beside. Do I recommend this game? The question weighed heavily on my mind for days on end, pervading every waking moment with its incessant inquisition.\\nYes. I suppose I can recommend this game, if you enjoy throwing money at walls to throw a small, single-color, virtual person at a wall over and over. I move my mouse and hesitantly click the checkmark instead of the thumbs-down icon. Nobody reads negative reviews, after all, and unfortunately there is no option for 'indifference' or perhaps 'Yes, but only if on sale first.' I paid forty nine American pennies for a sadomasochism simulator in the guise of a 'retro' platformer game.\\nI should have found two more quarters in my couch and bought a burger.\\nFurther edits as of 2017: This game has since received Cloud™(r) support and an engine overhaul,\",\n",

Then there's the graphics. I recommend to manually configure the graphics option in your NVIDIA control panel. The game isn't running 60fps (yet) but if configure it properly it runs very smoothly which for me whose sensitive in graphics slowness and lag. This game is very good once the small changes has been made. It's very easy just read the guide for additional help because at first it runs horribly and I know that the developer could have made a better setting than that but don't let those negative reviews fool you.

There's a ton of detail visible in the animation for even a single character, and it's clear they put a lot of effort into it. Gameplay-wise, it's a pretty fun mix of boss rushing and platforming that's considerably more boss rush than platformer, with most of the game being bosses and only 6 relatively short platforming stages. It's noteworthy for being difficult, and for the most part it earns that title, though it can also be a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t sometimes. It's fine if you're just going through it for the same of finishing the game, but once you get into replaying stages for high grades you start to notice things like the bosses sometimes not throwing enough parryable attacks at you for you to actually possibly get both the parrying and time bonuses for the stage without just restarting, and other similar issues arrising from the attack patterns being slightly random each time that lead to getting an A rank sometimes just being a matter of chance. Or how some mechanics are more of a curse than a blessing, like how the first super move becomes worthless pretty quickly because of how vulnerable it leaves you at the end of it, essentially giving the enemy a free hit most of the time, but if you let your meter fill up you don't have any choice to use it since you can't just use the smaller, cheaper special attacks instead once it's full.\\nIf you aren't going for grades then you don't have to worry about any of that, but then you have to worry about the game being fairly short; it doesn't take long to finish each stage once, and each time I reopened the game I was always surprised with how much my completion percentage had grown because it didn't feel long at all. The $20 price tag is paying more for the style than the amount of content, though, so it's really up to you if you think it's worth it or not.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'This may have been the most unique game I played this year. In Papers, Please, you play a immigration clerk screening immigrants for potential entry into the fictitious country of Arstotzka. Immigrants give you their paperwork and it’s up to you to process and find any discrepancies in their papers.\\nAt the end of the day you’ll have to choose how to spend your very small paycheck - on feeding your family, paying the heat bill, or providing your children their medicine. And you probably won’t have enough money for all of it. You’ll want to process as many immigrants as you can as quickly as possible, because you’re paid by how many you process per day. But you don’t want to go too fast or you may miss a discrepancy in their paperwork and have to pay a fine. It’s kind of a nerve wracking and depressing game to play. But I don’t mean that as a negative criticism of the game, it was clearly designed to invoke those kinds of emotions. You really get the feeling of what it’s like to be a desk clerk doing a menial but stressful job and getting paid next to nothing for it.\\nIt’s an interesting and unique indie game. It’s not my favorite, but it’s certainly different, which is always good.\\nFor more game reviews, check out',\n",

The graphics are pretty and the interface is really easy to use. For an Early Access game its suprisingly complete and polished.\\nUnfortunately I did encounter some graphical issues, but I feel that is more because my computer is at the low end of the (mac) system requirements, and not because of the game. The whole game just slowed to a lag fest by the end of tutorial 4 and 5 (so much is going on, onscreen), and the text was fairly unreadable in some areas from the start. Changing the settings didn't help much and made it worse at one point. So if you are reading this for opinions on tech specs, note that game is pretty resource intensive (pun not intended) so you might want to check your system requirements are closer to the recommended than the minimum.\\nThat said, I still recommend the game! Its a great resource management game, and if you like that kind of game you will love this.\",\n",

It's quite enjoyable to unlock new structures and lands that can then help you achieve further unlocks.\\nUnfortunately there is a mechanic where towns will actively go to war if they suddenly get too many resources, and if ther aren't any towns to attack they will prey on your titans. At first this was a nice challenge and forced me to try to up danger levels as well put the titans other skills to use. However when building upgrades are on a time limit you're forced into the position of increasing resources and boundaries, but then if the resources you need don't produce danger you have to put up with beating down warring jackasses for the next couple of minutes until they finally simmer down.\\nIt is unbelivably frustrating and it is unfortunate because up until that moment it was a fun game. Perhaps there was some secret method or technique I hadn't discerned to make the game less aggravating in the longer modes? I think it bears repeating that Reus is looks amazing and the general gameplay is interesting and enjoyable - up to a point. You will at least wring a few hours out of it, but if you're a completionist you will have to weather some extremely trying mechanics.\",\n",

In the campaigne the weapons that you collect you can upgrade them as you kill people and it makes the guns way better. But the campaigne is about 10 missions I think but they are kinda short and long depends on the difficulty. Suprisingly multiplayer is still pretty active i joined one and theres about 72 people playing online. The combat is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing dope I'll tell you. So that concludes my review I hope this helps you. and I give this game a 10/10.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Gone Home is one of the most fascinating gaming experiences that I have come across. The game takes place in 1996, when a girl named Katie comes back from a yearlong trip to Europe to her family’s newly inherited mansion, only to find the house empty. Katie explores the house to find out where her family members have gone and, at the risk of giving too much away, uncovers an engaging and often gloomy story.\\nGone Home has been one of the most polarizing games ever. Critics and players alike have raved about the story’s ability to invoke emotion as they slowly learn about all of the characters as they move through various rooms and examine items. However, there is a strong contingent of players who have strong feelings in opposition to the game, citing that there are “no game play mechanics besides walking around a house and digging through stuff” and that “it is remarkably short (around 2 hours)”. Some people were outraged that Gone Home would even be marketed as a game.\\nGone Home’s incredible polarization of players comes down to the different expectations people have of a video game. In traditional games, the expectation tends to be that there will be a significant amount of player-computer interaction, such as in shooting games, in which you shoot at the computer-generated characters and they shoot back at you. In Gone Home, however, we find that for the most part, your interactions with the game are one sided and are very rarely reciprocated. Therefore, people who expect the traditional style of game will ultimately be disappointed. What Gone Home creates is an experience that pushes the boundaries of what we define as a game and even makes us question if it is a game at all. Thus, assessing this game by the same criteria that you would any other would do it injustice.\\nWhether Gone Home is a game or not, its novel technique for story telling is one that should be replicated in the future. Gone Home creates a way for storytellers to give their viewers freedom to explore the story in a unique way, according to what interests them. This means that any person consuming the story can explore certain pieces of the story in greater or lesser detail as they please. This form of story telling creates a sense of freedom and personalization to the story being told. This cannot be said about other popular means of story telling such as books, movies and plays, in which the consumer experiences exactly what the author or director wants them to experience. Steve Gaynor, the writer and designer of Gone Home compared the experience to Sleep No More, a theater experience that takes place in a building in which audience members may roam, such that a viewer of the play experience differs based on where the viewer decide to focus their attention making each experience different from everyone else’s.\\nAll that being said, the story of Gone Home certainly isn’t perfect. A common criticism of the game is that the main story of the game involving Sam, the main character’s sister, realizing her sexuality is depicted in a very shallow manner. Steven Brummel of Plus10Damage writes, “Today, it is not easy to come out of the closet. As long as there is stigma, it never will be. But twenty years ago — in Gone Home's setting — it was much harder. Gone Home is a game set in the mid-90’s with people from 2013 trying to duplicate those feelings, and it just doesn’t succeed.”\\nBeyond the naïve depiction of Sam, in my playing of the game, I felt that much of the story was fairly unpredictable and often times I felt my exploration of the game was more of an obligation than a genuine hope of finding anything interesting.\\nBeyond the storytelling, the graphics and the mechanics contribute to the overall feeling and emotion of the game as a whole. The graphics of the game add a lot to the experience that the game creates. When compared to modern, big company games, the graphics certainly aren’t realistic however the textures create a sense of creepiness that looms throughout. The mechanics of the game, which employs a pick-up and inspect system, also adds to this experience. This system allows us to analyze in detail important items to the storyline. This allows the story to be told through these items more easily.\\nIn conclusion, Gone Home is a new, interesting approach to games that has polarized debate in the gaming world. Though its story and gameplay isn’t perfect, the game has popularized a new way to tell stories and paves the way for future games of its kind. This bold new approach to story telling is its self worthy of praise and the overall good story on top of this is just the icing on the cake.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Ichi's blueprint philosophy extends into the design beyond the colorful and inviting crayon aesthetic. While it comes packed with 60 premade levels for you to complete, these are merely a teaser for the main course that is making and playing user created levels. It's a one touch game with more depth than it gives itself credit for, but is simple enough to be instantly understandable to anyone that gives it a go.\\nAs I said, Ichi is a puzzle game that relies on a single touch to interact with the various mechanics within levels, with the goal being to bounce your ball around the screen collecting all the dots without running into spikes or getting overzealous with your taps (which will earn you a lower grade). The items you control start off simply, with triangles that rotate or disappear with a touch, but then evolve into more complex tools from switches to portals and various others which add upon each other to make puzzles more complex and engaging. Despite this, my biggest issue with Ichi is that all the developer made levels are surprisingly easy, to where I rarely felt any challenge from them up to the very end. Ultimately they act more like a tutorial to the user generated levels than something to fill a game with in their own right.\\nThankfully, with already 20,000+ created and more popping up every day, there are tons and tons of absolutely brilliant user created puzzles that will give you a far greater challenge if you want it. A handy tagging and rating system makes sorting through them easier than you'd expect, and a simple (if slightly over restrictive) editor allows you to forge your own puzzles should you feel no one has made one that's just quite right for you yet. It took a long time to get here, but in the end Ichi is just as much fun as it was when I first played it ages ago long before it managed to get on Steam, and can recommend it without reservation to anyone interested in an immensely easy to put up and hard to put down puzzler.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Right, so this one is a doozy. As you can see, I have a substantial amount of hours on this game. I do enjoy it quite a lot. However, if you are not  accustomed to survival games, particularly ones where you must work hard for gear, and loot, you may not enjoy this game. Now, the way I see it, there are two ways to play.\\nOPTION 1: Just play on regular public servers, get gear, group up with friends, kill others, or befriend others.\\nOPTION 2: This one, is much more fun for me, I like to play on whitelisted roleplay servers. This relieves many of the frustrations of being killed on sight for no reason after spending hours gathering items for survival.  The community I play with is very fun, and enhances the game quite a bit for me.\\nIn conclusion, DayZ is a game for a selective audience. If you aren't used to the survival game grind, then this may not be the game for you. However, if you do enjoy that type of thing, like me, you will have a lot of fun on this game.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"You know, I imagine when Andy Warhol was a creator of art and released his Campbell's Soup Can piece in 1962 which was at the time a statement of how art in a capitalist society was becoming utilitarian, people who were in the know of the art movement were very divided about how they felt about it, just as how people are now divided over The Beginner’s Guide.\\nI thought for sure that Final Fantasy XV demo was going to be the weirdest thing I would have played all year but Davey Wreden of The Stanley Parable fame had to go and stealth release a game on steam.\\nI remember a bit in the Stanley Parable where the narrator, I think in a trailer or maybe, asks rather sarcastically “can games be considered art?” which was kind of the whole theme of the Stanley Parable where he was just kind of poking fun at these questions and exploring them a bit from a comedic angle and now having played The Beginner’s Guide a lot of that now seems pretty defensive, like Davey himself was making a joke about it because  he didn’t really feel comfortable about his own work, which is kind of sobering.\\nWhich goes back to the campbells soup can thing. I think the utilitarian view of games, the review and press culture that hypes up games of being a certain gameplay hours per dollar ratio and lists features of the game like one would review a car or a mattress, is a large force behind the creation and releasing of this game. I think he feels like his games which are kind of these viewed as these “pretentious artsy fartsy walking sims” by many gamers really gets to Davey. I think he worries that people will think of him as a guy who makes weird games for the sake of being weird and that people will not understand his motivations.\\nI do genuinely think he is trying to push the medium forward, but after the Stanley Parable and after the critical acclaim it got from game critics, I don’t think he knows how. So now we have this which is sort of like an extremely personal, to the point of discomfort, cautionary tale for creators about the struggle with being recognized for your creativity.\\nAnd I really mean discomfort because while the game really did make me have a long hard think, it also was not an entirely always pleasant experience which is obviously the point, but I can really see people being turned off by it.\\nI’m still going to recommend the game even though I don’t know how exactly I feel about it because I think this is probably one of the most interesting games released this year. So if what I just wrote sounds like artsy fartsy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to you then yeah don’t buy it, but if you played and enjoyed the Stanley Parable or are a content creator yourself then I would say this is worth a look. But, this is also the first time I wish Steam had a neutral, in between, option for its user reviews, because that is closer to how I felt. Some of the negative reviews I’ve seen people put up I actually agree with in some respects. It’s a polarizing experience which might be all the more reason why it’s worth giving a look because that’s often what some of the most memorable art does.\",\n",

Especially if you like to try your hand at beurocratic tasks in a video game in an exciting way.  It\\'s monotonous, but enjoyable.   I know it\\'s less than 20 hours to get 100%, but I logged in (at the time of this writing) at least 43 hours of gameplay.  It\\'s that good.\\nYou play as an unknown inspector who was elected through a lottery to work\\nas a border inspector between the cursed Kolechia and the wonderous motherland Arstotzka for one month.  But you have a time limit in which you can work, which adds pressure to your performance.  Inspect more and provide the correct responses quickly to get paid more.  Make mistakes and it\\'ll come out of your paycheck after 2 free warnings a day.  By the end of the day, you\\'ll need to pay for rent, food (optional), heat (optional), medical bills (optional if heat or food is neglected), and various other opportunities.  You play as a father providing for your family.  If your family dies (or other conditions occur), the game is over.   It\\'s also a plus that it throws in ethical dillemas to keep you on your toes.\\nPeople say this game is communistic and I\\'d say I agree with their statements.  You are playing in a job you did not choose and are dissuaded from trying to make more than you actually do...which makes it understandable why people would take bribes in communistic or socialist countries.\\nThere are various paths you can take to different endings.  You can choose to complete your tasks in a purely beaurocratic manner for the motherland Arstotzka, you can help aid in a revolution for the Order of the EZIC Star, or you can escape Arstotzka by moving away with forged passports.   The fate of the people, the nation, and your family are in your hands.\\nPROS:\\nAddicting gameplay\\nGreat (yet simple) story\\nGreat challenges\\nNice Puzzles (if you choose to work for EZIC)\\nImplementation of ethical dillemas\\nNo bugs\\nRandomized portraits and stats based on a database (great programming)\\nArstotzka  (Joke pro.

       "  'text': 'Long, long ago, in an era occurring only slightly after the death of the last dinosaur, there were these ancient artifacts called - wait for it - \"text adventures\".\\nThey were among the very first \"video games\", even if they barely resembled the infinitely more snazzy products we now refer to by that name. The earliest examples of this genre of gaming didn\\'t even have GRAPHICS, for cryin\\' out loud! They were no more than words...on a screen...which you interacted with by typing MORE words on the screen. Crazy, right?\\nBut it\\'s true: there was indeed a time in our darkest past where, if you wanted any level of immersion in a game deeper than one white bar hitting a dot towards another white bar (hello, Pong!), you were pretty much stuck with your imagination doing ninety-nine percent of the work for you.\\nLet\\'s face it: it was practically child abuse, by today\\'s lofty standards.\\nFast forward to the year 2017, and what\\'s this? Some game developer calling itself No Code (a double entendre, I presume) releases a four-episode game called Stories Untold, which at least partially carries on in the spirit of such text adventures...before adding some significant multi-genred twists, and a substantially more varied and modern visual interface.\\nThe most common viewpoint given in the first three episodes, at least, is that of the player themselves seated at an old-school desktop computer into which you can type commands, and for the first of the four episodes that\\'s literally all that you can do. As the episodes progress, however, the player\\'s interactions expand to other objects/machines about their workstation, which must also be fiddled with to make headway.\\nIt\\'s all quite clever, really; even if I ultimately found myself favouring the first and most \"traditional\" of the bunch, a spectacularly spooky number entitled The House Abandon.\\nI first played this episode as a standalone game/demo quite some time ago, at the behest of a friend who generally plays neither horror nor text adventure games. It was available for free on a game-sharing site, and my friend (who had only been brave enough to watch a YouTube walkthrough) thought it might be well up my alley. He certainly wasn\\'t wrong; though I at first suspected he might have been, especially in his assertion that a hardened horror game addict like myself might find it genuinely SCARY.\\nA text adventure? Scary?! I may well have wondered what drugs or alcohol this friend of mine had been scoffing, if I didn\\'t know him as an all-but-teetotaller. He even mentioned a few occasions when the girl he viewed in the video visibly JUMPED in fright at what the game threw at her. Haha, indeed, I thought. Young, hysterical girlies on YouTube is one thing, but I\\'m a man in his forties and a hardcore horror fanatic, darn it all to Hades. Sure enough, a slightly harrowing twenty-five minutes later, I was tucking my tail between my legs and confirming to my friend how very right he had been.\\nUnfortunately, this tone of terror gradually subsides as the episodes of Stories Untold progress, and the parser-based typing largely makes way for more familiar adventure game puzzling and even a bit of first-person wandering. It\\'s still very well-done, and there\\'s still a consistent aura of dread to proceedings; it\\'s just a shame that the seat-of-the-pants intuitiveness of the first episode is replaced by no end of tricky code-breaking and pedantic instruction-following, placing the last three-quarters of the game in the territory of a more familiar and contemporary adventure-gaming style, as opposed to the sheer green-screen era goodness of the game\\'s earliest moments.\\nOr, to put it another way: if you\\'re as bad at puzzles as I am, you\\'ll happily stumble your way through the first episode without needing to peek at a walkthrough, while constantly referring to one for all that comes after.\\nIt\\'s also a shame that the brilliantly enigmatic ending of The House Abandon is not only explained, but almost OVER-explained by the end of the four episodes. The storytelling still remains strong throughout, but a part of me can\\'t help but feel that the attempt to \"link\" the four episodes together into a singular storyline was a somewhat misguided effort, and it may have been better if they\\'d just told four unrelated tales.\\nIt\\'s still an excellent game, overall, and can hardly be faulted for lack of invention. I\\'m certainly intrigued to see what No Code get up to next.\\nVerdict: 8.5/10.\\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages:\\nCheers!)',\n",

       "  'text': 'The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav is a nice addition for anyone who´s into the point-n-click genre. Even though I´m not familiar with the Dark Eye World I found it an interesting setting. The story line is by no means original but the narrative still feels solid and keeps you as a player interested in seeing how the story will play out.\\nAs other reviewers have done I will also recommend playing the game on hard difficulty since the game does become a bit to easy when played on easy with the help modes enabled. The main use I see for the easy difficulty is for those who wishes to play the game more like a visual novel, since the story and narrative is good this is a viable option. I found most of the puzzles to make sense and only the Fairy World may be considered a bit out of the ordinary in that department. The inclusion of a break/repair option was great since it creates more possibilities for item combinations without having to add more items to find in game.\\nOn graphics one have to mention the backgrounds which look amazing and the character models are also great to look at when they are stationary. The animations are however not that good and both movement and facial expressions are jerky while the lip-sync in dialogues is even worse. Since one does get used to the faults and still get´s to enjoy the beautiful backgrounds the total impression on graphics is still very positive.\\nMusic/Audio is for the most time quite nice even though I did find the protagonist Geron to be a bit whiny in the first chapters of the game. He does seem to mature or rather face up to the challenge as the game progresses which is a nice touch. The other characters, both minor and major ones, are well voice acted and adds to the overall positive experience when playing the game.\\nIn short I will recommend this game for fans of the point-n-click genre and I would also view it as a good game for those who does not have much experience with puzzle games but want to try one out. The full prize of 20 € does feel a bit steep since the game is not that long but at a sale it´s good time value.',\n",

So, you I'll get things like objects and cars almost popping in your front.\\nAnd ff you hate problematic physics in games, stay away from this one too.\\n[This section may change as long as they update graphic options.]\\nThe campaing in this game is very basic, like in any other racing game, but it's funny. And it's very nice to play with other friends, but it's not a requirement. Pvp is not a big deal. The car customization is very wide in the majority, but very limited in some car specs. And for a racing game like this one, I expected more cars, and less DLC-only content.\\nThis game is good overall.

       "  'text': \"22 of my 50 hours of gameplay are of the actual Fallout 2 - I have that one memorized backwards since I was ~14, the rest I spent on the superb fanmade seq/prequel, Fallout 1.5: Resurrection. This is going to be 2 reviews in one and I can't say that I care if that's okay or not.\\nstays true to the old school Fallout vibe and is aptly named with the mod being very much in-between Fallout 1 and 2. Resurrection starts in 2170, 8-9 years after Fallout 1 and well before 2241, the starting year of Fallout 2. You'll have to deal with the aftermath of the dispersion of the Master's super mutant army. Story wise Resurrection is closer to Fallout 1, being a lot more serious, mature and scientifically plausible than Fallout 2. In comparison, it seems Creative had their drawers stacked to the brim with jokes and pop culture references that then required a game to be built around them with Fallout 2.\\nI did figure out the main plot at about the 10 minute point, but generally I very much enjoyed discovering another piece of the Fallout universe.\\nI've even made a modest walkthrough in case you're a perfectionist and want to get it 'right' the first time around:\\nThe overwhelmingly positive reviews others have left should convince anyone who hasn't played classic Fallout yet to change their ways, so I'm not even going to go into every aspect of the game.\\nAs I've already mentioned, Fallout 2 is a lot more jokey than its predecessor, featuring a ghost, aliens, a super mutant magician, talking mole rats, Skynet, Mike Tyson, civil deathclaws, Tragic: The Garnering, scientologists named Juan Cruz and Vicki Goldman and the POTUS to name a few. If it's hard to imagine a story arc that incorporates all of these seamlessly then you're probably on to something. I can't say that all this humor is somehow bad though, just know that Fallout 1 and 2 are different and you may find the latter not quite what you would've expected.\\nI've read a few reviews that call Fallout 2 'slow' and being a total fanboy had to stop and think for a second to digest this criticism, but it's true. 2's story starts off really boring and I applaud any millennial that can sit through Arroyo and Klamath without deleting the game. Without using Cheat Engine or somesuch, shooting and missing a rat or gecko for the 23rd time really is for the dead-of-brain. But I swear from The Den and on the game improves by an order of magnitude with the high points coming in New Reno, which provides much to do in itself (like boxing and starring in porn) beside being a nexus for many quests from other towns.\\nA small annoyance I noticed during my female playthrough was that Fallout 2 is very obviously a game by guys, for guys. Male PCs get a whole extra ending for New Reno, can donate sperm to alleviate the inbreeding situation in Vault City and have dozens of extra pervy dialogue options to use compared to females who can at most suck D to save a few hundred caps here and there. Caps, by the way, which are infinite after you get to ~120% in gambling. Can't say I blame Black Isle too much though because if you think of how many people owned a computer in 1998, played games on it, had the intellectual capacity to grok RPGs and out of that tiny sliver of the population, how many were women, well... peddling encyclopedias at Bible study might have been a better business model than catering to girls with Fallout 2.\\nAs customary with RPGs, save often and into different slots. I recommend always keeping around a save from the first second you arrive in a new marked location so you could replay it if need be.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Sniper Elite V2 is pretty much great as sniping goes. It has good (but arcade-y) ballistics, good wind and the \"snipe cam\" effect doesn\\'t get old as fast as you\\'d think it\\'d do. It gives decent to great satisfaction when you nail a long range shot. The scoring system is somewhat superflous personally, aside from friend bragging rights. You do have to adjust your scope for longest (<100 meter) shots, which doesn\\'t make any frigging sense, but it\\'s there for gameplay purposes to make it a little harder and more satisfying nailing that long range shot.\\nSound and graphics are both competent, but nothing beyond that. There\\'s nothing that stands out as amazing, and on occasion you can run into some fairly ugly textures. Enemies also keep \"spamming\" voicelines when they are searching for you, or in combat. Even with just one or two enemies, expect to hear taunts and \"Keep looking!\" every 3 or 4 seconds.\\nWeapon sounds are extremely weak aside from the signature sniper rifles. MP40\\'s and other automatic rifles sound more like peashooters than actual weapons, and their accuracy is abysmal in everything but close combat.\\nAs far as gameplay goes is where this game completely falls flat as an exciting sniping game, and I\\'d say that if you are after that, get any of the Hitman games instead. This game has a fatal flaw that completely ruins the experience you have. It\\'s way too scripted. Enemies will not be present unless you\\'ve passed a specific trigger, making it impossible to \"clear the way\" for future areas by finding a good spot and taking out all enemies. Especially the \"Blow up the bridge\" mission was EXTREME for this, as the last part has no less than FOUR such trigger points very tightly together, forcing you into close combat with recently spawned enemies, and then three snipers that all spawn as you walk into their line of sight. You have 0 chance of spotting them before hand and take them out from range, instead you have to duck and cover and play \"peekaboo\" with them.\\nThe mission before that had one gauntlet event spawn right behind you, even though you had perfectly stealthily gone through the previous area. Suddenly it\\'s flooded with enemies that instantly know where you are, and you have no way of avoiding said event. Instead you have to fight your way out with hordes of enemies, leaving you feeling less like a sniper and more like Rambo, which is not what I was looking for when I got a game named \"Sniper Elite\".\\nI couldn\\'t bring myself to finish the game due to those very \"gamey\" moments that kept pulling me out of the experience, and it does leave the game feeling lacklustre. Part of the stealth mechanics are also quite odd as you can barely ever take out an emey stealthily with your sniper rifle due to the lack of suppression or the \"Loud Noise\"-mechanic introduced in a few levels.\\nDo I recommend this game? Not if you are looking for a pure sniping experience where you have to survey the area, have a plan of attack and use a lot of stealth. If you are after a mediocre run and gun experience with occasional sniping elements then sure, get it. But otherwise I wouldn\\'t bother unless it was on a deep sale. In addition, you should stay the HELL away from the DLC. It\\'s mindboggingly boring.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Building on the long line of the Battlefield series, Bad Company 2 continues the focus of Bad Company 1’s team tactics, cover destruction, and vehicle usage. There are 4 classes, which you get weapons for by playing as the class and scoring points. Those points also go towards improving your soldier rank, which occasionally gives you certain global unlocks as your progress. The game’s cover system focuses on making most cover destructible to a certain degree, and new to this game are certain destructible buildings.\\nBut let me warn those that enjoy more death match style games: This is heavily reliant on team strategy. In this way, the game can be frustrating at times, but also very rewarding when you use actual tactics to out maneuver the enemy. With at least one more map pack and an expansion releasing soon, Bad Company 2 may not live up to the greatness of Battlefield 2, but it more than delivers a delicious team based shooter for $20.',\n",

It’s the 'potential' of a happy ending that makes it the title it is – and the end result just causes the whole thing to hit closer to home. How many of us have had a crush on someone at school, and tried to further that relationship through the use of a messenger client after home-time only to have it fail awkwardly? We were all that teenager once and, even though it won’t appeal to everyone and would benefit from a little more content, Kyle Seeley’s project does a remarkable job at capturing that feeling.\\nA full review of Emily is Away can be found here:\",\n",

You'll be following the main quest. You'll find yourself running into Oblivion portals a lot. ( Duh. ) The story can be intimidating in the beginning as there are lots of Deadra warriors you'll be fighting. You'll have to be especially careful as a low level. I found myself spawning some Steel armor to help me through the first Oblivion gate. Also had to put on God mode once or twice. The game will get easier as you progess in your skills.\\nGraphics:\\nThe Graphics are well done for it's time. You'll often see castle walls, river, lakes, and some towns. Even from a distance the graphics hold up. The faces of the CPU's are ( Mostly ) Normal. You may run into a few faces that just don't look human. ( And I'm not talking about Argonians or Kahjiits.)\\nMusic:\\nThe music for this game is incredible. Obviously, the main theme for all the Elder Scrolls games are the same. The music during battle is AMAZING. But when there is a serious moment, the music softens. You may have to turn up the music and turn down the other effects though.\\nOver all, the game is definitley worth getting.

It does get repetitious a bit after playing it, but there are enough game modes to make up for that. I've found that if you have a good strategy, winning on mega brutal is even easy (with the same strategy). There are only minor modifications between most modes though, but it atleast it different modes do require varying strategies. And it just never gets old to kill the entire human race! If you loved the pandemic flash games, than chances are high that you'll enjoy this games. It is much more polished and worth it if you are craving a laid back strategy game. If the game is on sale, I'd definitely recommend picking it up.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I enjoy this game\\'s visual aesthetic, and its sound effects are nice. I also like the towers themselves, for the most part. However, I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever played a more stressful tower defense game in my life. Keep in mind that I love Sanctum 2, and it has you running all over the place and shooting at enemies while you\\'re getting attacked, and alternating primary and secondary fire and different guns, worrying about reloading fast enough to kill enemies before they reach the core, etc. With PixelJunk Monsters, however, if you take even a second to try to strategize mid-game, you\\'re probably already screwed. How so? Well, let\\'s see...\\nThe mobs of enemies come in a few seconds after the map loads. You do not have time to look at it and decide where to put a tower. In fact, there are typically multiple spawn points on every map, and the game never tells you which point the next wave will be spawning from until they\\'re already there, and by then, it\\'s probably too late for you to build a tower that will be sufficient. While I\\'m reeling from seeing which side the enemy is already barreling down and I\\'m trying to play damage control to just barely stop them in time, the next wave is about to spawn, and by the time I finish dealing with the first wave, the second wave has already spawned. Which side(s) do they spawn on? Good luck guessing. Choose poorly and you\\'re going to lose some lives. Building from the end outward will help, but only so much, due to the range and firing speeds of the towers.\\nWell, at least you can just sit back and spend money like crazy, building towers fast and succeed, right? Haha, no. The whole time your towers are killing, you control a little Tiki guy who you have to run around to pick up coins the enemies drop. Don\\'t go fast enough? The coins disappear, meaning you are permanently handicapped on that run in terms of how much you have to spend on towers. Gem stones also drop on occasion, and if you don\\'t pick those up, you could miss them, too.\\nGem stones are used to unlock the superior towers a few minutes into each match, and not only do you have to make sure you grab them when enemies drop them, but there are also two trees in a literal small forest on every map which will pop out a gem stone each. If you don\\'t find these, chances are you will be delayed in getting the superior towers, which will likely lead to more lives lost, because the inferior towers are worthless against certain enemies.\\nOn that note, enemies will spawn with a glow to them; a certain color. They might be green, blue, red, or not glow at all. The game doesn\\'t tell you what this means. Each glow typically means the enemy is weak to a certain \"element\" from your towers. It\\'s nothing super obvious and clear cut. You will need to either resort to trial and error, or look up a walkthrough to figure out what towers you need. If you don\\'t get the right tower(s), chances are you\\'re about to game over. All of the elemental towers are locked and require gem stones to unlock, so no, you can\\'t just build one of everything to protect yourself, either, because you likely won\\'t have enough gemstones to unlock more than one or two types of towers by the time these enemies pop up.\\nWell, if you just keep wildly running around like mad, at\\nyou can get into the groove of that quick motion and keep things happening, right? Pffft, no. The game also expects you to either stand next to a tower,\\ndoing the many other vital tasks, while waiting for a slowly-filling bar to fill up as your character dryly dances beside the tower to increase its stats. I could spend gem stones to level a tower faster, but then I don\\'t have enough gem stones to unlock an elemental tower and the glowing enemies waltz by my non-elemental towers and give me a game over.\\nSo let\\'s recap! The game wants you to run around searching trees for gem stones\\nsetting up towers and having to physically have your character next to the build site to place them,\\nknowing where to build which towers despite having no clue which of the multiple entrances the enemies will come from,\\ncollecting the coins and gem stones they drop,\\ndancing next to towers to level them up very slowly,\\nwatching for the element(s) to unlock to deal with whatever color glow the enemies show up with. So much being demanded of the player simultaneously and immediately removes the ability to strategize, which, in my opinion, is one of the vital elements of a tower defense, instead calling for rapid, sloppy actions and an inability to ever feel satisfied with watching my towers kill enemies, because I\\'m overloaded with busy work the second the game starts.\\nLike I said, Sanctum 2 is an exciting TD/FPS hybrid, and I loved it. Back in highschool, I thought \"eustress\" was a stupid vocabulary word. Who ever heard of \"good stress?\" No stress at all is better, or so I thought. Then I began looking deeper into things, and it finally clicked that there is such a thing as good stress. Having something to do every day, even if it isn\\'t necessarily \"fun,\" that gets you out of bed is an important thing in life. You might have stressors, but all stress isn\\'t bad. It can be good and makes life interesting and helps with honing skills and even getting better at a job to be ready for promotions or potentially managing, etc. However, if there is stress in your life that drives you to anger and frustration regularly, it\\'s not eustress. It\\'s just a thorn in your side that should be pulled out and discarded. PixelJunk Monsters has no qualities that can redeem it for me, as it drives me to anger without any positive fulfillment or satisfaction.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Honestly my favourite of the series so far.\\nScore breakdown-\\nGameplay: 8/10. The sandbox of SR2 has been upgraded, given a new coat of paint, and had a ton of secrets stuck into it. The gunplay is also improved, and the car physics reach the balance point between racing-sim realistic and action-movie stupid. Lack of customisation is disappointing, though.\\nGraphics and Art Style: 9/10. It takes a lot of effort to make a giant purple rubber wang look like something badass, is all I'm saying.\\nWriting: 8/10. Even though most dialogue exchanges are serious, there's an overarching sense of self-awareness and humour that makes the game stand out. And when they do make a proper joke, it's generally pretty funny, and some made me have the pause the game, lest my giggles mess up the level.\\nMusic and Sound Design: 8/10. There's lots of liscenced songs to listen to, and the rather infamous parachute penthouse raid scene is made all the more memorable by a rather well-placed Kanye West song.\\nStability and Glitch Control: 9/10. Glitches are uncommon, and never game-breaking. The worst that will happen is some teleporting enemies.\\nOverall score: 8.4/10. It's the standout in a series known for being standout. Plus it's usually cheaper than chips when the summer sales come around.\",\n",

When the time came for the expansion, Steam did not recognize The Realm Reborn game. So I had to purchase the bundle deal and was anticipating to play the expansion. When I downloaded the game it was for Realm Reborn, I tried inserting the CD key to Mog Station and it said that it was invalid. I contacted Steam and Square Enix asking for a refund but they would offer it. They only recommend me to purchase another copy of Stormblood, even though I purchased it but can't use the CD-key. I would like the both companies to communitcate and work together on the bundle deals and the Stormblood CD-key's. You guys have lost a avid gamer to this.

So I bought this game for $90 and now I have to pay another $40 just to use all the commanders in the game? money grab and I despise it.\\nI hope the future patches fix matchmaking slowness and allow unlocks of the commanders through gameplay.\\nWould recommend because it really is an excellent game, deep stratergy and great atmosphere.\",\n",

Pro's are that the game is fun to play and that team cooperation makes a HUGE difference whether you will succeed in completing the mission or not which is a big plus in my book (selfishness is not rewarded here). Con's are that since the last update enemys can litteraly materialize out of thin air around you or worse, behind you, which kinda feels unfair to me (it was the main reason why I stoped playing L4d2 back in the day) since there is nothing in the world you can do in order to prevent the following damage you take by these spawning foes. Another major issue is the reward system which to put plainly - SUCKS BALLS. If this is the developers attempt to cause through intermittent conditioning an addiction to the game amongst the game's players than it might not be working as planned. This is the main issue for the increasing lack of motivation that I feel to continue playing this game. There is ZERO correlation between how good you played through the round you just finished or the amount of dice, tomes and grimoires you collected during that round to the quality of the loot you will receive. You can have the most amazing round and still recieve crap items. In fact, it seems that that is the default mode. After finishing more than 100 different rounds of the game I can testify to only about 3 good drops. Thats it. And my main character still doesn't have anything close to the weapons it should have at this point. Last point, the game crashes. Not as bad as a few weeks ago but it still happens about every tenth game. Also, if the games host leaves the game the game will restart which is just lame and frustrating. I hope the developers fix these issues in the near future. The bottom line is that the game is a lot of fun to play but still has several major issues that should be addressed.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Civ 6 is an extremely fun game despite its significantly flawed AI and lack of cross-play between Mac and PC systems.\\n: The most noteable change from previous Civ games is the district system. At first confusing, it eventually plays out to be an awesome strategic element. Hours of gameplay teach you the ideal tiles to place a district based on extra yields and the potential for satisfying wonder requirements, tech boosts, and civic boosts. I find the district system to be extremely enjoyable.\\n: I don\\'t like the barbarian mechanics in this game. My go-to strategy to start the game is to build a warrior before anything else. This is for the sole reason that barbarians can pose a significant and existential threat. Some games you\\'re fine and no barbarians spawn near you for a while. Other games, a camp spawns 6 tiles from your city and starts spamming horsemen after 6 turns of being alive and before you can research spearman to effectively counter them...\\n: I think thatcombat in general is pretty well thought out. You\\'re given a break-down of your unit\\'s combat bonuses and the enemy unit\\'s combat bonuses before you fight which makes it easier to make informed decisions during wars. In most games I\\'ve played, though, air units are a complete waste of time. The district required to build them (the Aerodrome) is understandably only available in the later ages, usually when you have a certain victory goal within reach and when producing air units would not make sense. The air units cost significant production and their upgrades are very close to each other on the tech tree so that they become outdated very fast. The building upgrades in the Aerodrome that help produce more experienced air units are also expensive and not worth the production time, all things considered. The systemic flaws in air combat don\\'t really stem from bad design, but are part of the inherent nature of the timeline of the game...\\n: Creating religions in this game is very fun and satisfying. However, even with recent adjustments to the Religion system, I still think it\\'s one of the hardest victories to achieve. The bonuses religion provides are awesome, spreading it is very hard. However, this makes some sense considering Religion is one of the two victories (Domination the other) you could theoretically win in the Ancient era.\\n: It\\'s turn 15 in the Ancient era. Harald Hardrada sends you a message. He has denounced you for \"your navy is weak\". Your capitol is on the mainland away from the coast, unable to produce boats... It\\'s now turn 26, still in the ancient era. Catherine de Medici sends you a message. She has denounced you for \"lack of espionage\".  Spies can\\'t be researched until the Renaissance era... It\\'s now turn 30. Gilgamesh sends you a message. He has denounced you becaused \"he just plain doesn\\'t like you\". Every copy of a luxury resource you own is now useless as no other civ wants to trade with you because they all hate you. France and Poland are both going to declare war on you at turn 32 even though there\\'s no reason they should both declare war at the same time. Announcing friendships with other civs is nigh impossible as you always suffer a negative diplomatic penalty of \"-3 their first impressions of you\". 90% of the time you will give a negative first impression and there is nothing that tells you why. Any kind of war with another civ results in being permanently denounced by everyone for the rest of the game, sometimes even when you didn\\'t start the war.\\nI\\nthe AI in this game. It is so deeply flawed in a game-design sense and it can - and quite often does - make the game un-fun. Firaxis has tried many times to improve the AI, but has never come even close to making the system healthy. Each change has been incremental and felt more like a band-aid solution than anything. The AI system in Civ 6 is just wholesale poor.\\n: I think that the roster of civs to choose from is very good. There seems to be a civ for just about any playstyle and each new civ released feels fresh and unique. The only downside is much of the roster is paid DLC. However, for a game I\\'ve poored hundreds of hours into, this is something that has just come with the territory.\\n: This game can be extremely fun and the process of getting better at the game is enjoyable. I find it most entertaining when playing with friends, which makes me kind of sad I\\ncan\\'t play with my Mac friends since I play on PC. I would recommend this game despite some of its significant flaws.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Contrast is an all-round great game with a nice story, style and gameplay. It is well deserving of the various awards that came its way.\\nThe style of the game, from the graphics in the environment to the character and the music is reminiscent of a noir-cabaret-early 1900s style. It all plays very well together and creates a very immersive game. The story itself follows this style, starting off somewhat light hearted but quickly revealing darker undertones. The characters of the game are engaging [rather than just being 2-dimensional], which helps add to the atmosphere of the story. It is short, but that's probably a good thing. Leave people wanting more.\\nThe gameplay is also very good. The puzzle aspect of interacting between 2 and 3 dimensions based on shadows is a pretty neat and unique way of creating a platformer. This, accompanied by the great level design [which reminds me of psychonauts], provides for some great jumping puzzles and various other platformer-style gameplay. The addition of using light to manipulate the environment, rather than light sources being static is a great idea to break the gameplay up.\\nI did have a few niggling remarks about the fact that sometimes you get kicked out of 2D play if the game thinks you are 'stuck' when you're not, but the lack of a permanent fail state [i.e. you fall out of the world, and you immediately respawn] helps to alleviate this.\\nSo yes, this is a game worth playing. For fans of Noir stories and platformers alike.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Well sadly this is a complete clusterf*ck of a port. One of the worst performing games i\\'ve played on PC. Right off the bat when you first start playing,  the game will (EDIT: you might get lucky and not have it crash on you) crash when you reach the first cutscene, the solution to this is to turn off the automatic steam saves. i still had a few crashes sometimes after doing that but it was playable.\\nAlso they messed the rain up on this release (it\\'s too big, and looks ugly) there is a mod to make it smaller and look like it did on the console release though. Also the frame rate is horrendous, it would routinely drop to the mid teens for me during fights, there are mods and things that help improve the frame rate, but if you use them then when you reach a cutscene the audio will be out of sync...so weigh it, you either lose framerate or audio sync.\\nIf the PC is your only choice to play the game then it is playable once you disable the steam saves and tinker with frame rate mods, but if you have a PS3 or Xbox 360 then get it on that.\\nAs for the game itself, i thought it was pretty good, i did like the time travel aspect, but then i\\'m a sucker for time travel stuff. It can get annoying though if you are trying to get these side mission fragment pieces, you will have to travel to 2 or sometimes 4 different time zones of the same area to complete the mission, that\\'s tedious. I gave up even trying to collect all the fragments (there\\'s 160 in total, i have like 80 of em) eventually and just grinded away in fights until i was strong enough to finish the main game.\\nA couple of things they improved over FFXIII are that the areas you explore are bigger, so they listened to the criticism, and also you can see the enemies before you fight them and also run away from them if you want, so you are not forced to fight them most of the time, unless they are faster than you and jump you.\\nThe actual meat of the game, the fighting they improved and made it faster and more streamlined from what i remember from FFXIII but there\\'s only 2 chracters you play as in this, Serah and Noel. There are monsters that you can capture through battle and level up and infuse and combine with other monsters to create hybrid mega pokemon things that fight beside you in battle. I didn\\'t do any of that, i had this one little light bulb looking guy who had an lightning ability with a green flower on his head who i maxed out, but i didn\\'t combine him, i managed to finish the game by only using him on my team but he kept dying and i had to constantly resurrect the lil muppet. It\\'s possible to complete the game without infusing them, but maybe learn from my mistake and look up some guides to find out which ones to infuse with each other and what not.\\nThe story itself is not very good, i didn\\'t like how literally 2 seconds after the screen fades to black at the end of FFXIII they say time got all f*cked up and distorted and Lightning disappeared and Serah is the only one who remembers she existed. Not even a day passed!, that was stupid.\\nAlso kinda spoilers mebbe but not that much, the game can\\'t really stand on it\\'s own, if you haven\\'t played FFXIII you will have no clue what is going on, i did play it and i still had no idea, i had a slight idea but not a fully formed one. There\\'s actually text at the end of this that says \"To be continued\" FFXIII had a definitive conclusion, but i guess they decided to make this and Lightning Returns together, and the third one is in some ways even more out there than this one. Don\\'t play this if you haven\\'t played FFXIII and don\\'t play it if you don\\'t plan on playing Lightining returns either.\\nOnce you do finish the main story, more areas open up and also a coliseum where you can fight and recruit opponents like Lightning and Snow. I think some or all of this stuff is DLC from the consoles which is nice, but i dunno if i can be bothered messing with that stuff.\\nTL;DR gme plyble aftr fkn wid it, stry nt gud as FFXIII (also learn to read c*nt lol)',\n",

       "  'text': \"Following in the wake of the rising trend of 'walking simulators'\\nattempts to create an intriguing atmosphere with its setting but ends up disappointing with its lack of depth.\\nGone Home sets up a quite interesting premise. You return from your trip to Europe back home, in the middle of a storm, only to find it empty. Your family is not there and it's up to you to discover what has happened to them. The story is unfolded in written form with some audio cues when some events are triggered and that formula works well up to a certain point in the overall plotline.\\nIt does sound fascinating right? Especially if you add the creepy undertones in the various notes and letters you'll find and combine that with visual and audio effects the game lays out for you, you have a tantalizing plot for you discover. However Gone Home will not push beyond what it has in the surface. Whatever you might or might not expect, disappointment is always around the corner and with an incredibly short duration, there's not really room to further explore the characters or some hints to subplots which might compensate for a very predictable main arc.\\nThe magic of the walking simulator genre lies in creating a vibrant world and characters who will excite the imagination of the player. Pure expositional dialogue is the genre's own worst enemy and Gone Home has that in spades. The plot is revealed very early in the game and after that you're left with a very predictable outcome which you will see coming a mile away. All the air of mystery and perhaps hints for supernatural elements are quickly dissolved away within the first 20 minutes. After that the experience becomes more of a chore and less of a unique perspective into the world of the characters and the story itself.\\nWithout spoiling too much of the\\nstory, some of the dialogue and voice acting are decent enough but the game never dares to go someplace different than where you expect it to go. It doesn't experiment, it doesn't challenge, it will not evoke a strong emotional response, it will leave you there half-interested and feeling like you need to get this over with. For me that's a mark of a poorly designed game.\\nRegardless of that, I can understand why some people might relate to the story, and if you do then more power to you. My problem with Gone Home is not the story itself but how it is presented to the player. It is very uninspired and sophomoric to say the least and that's the game's greatest downfall. I'll admit that there were times where the spirit of the game merges well with the otherwise quirky soundtrack but all of that crumbles down when you listen to the next part of the expositional monologue.\\nI did enjoy some parts of Gone Home but overall it felt like a very disappointing experience. Partly because of expectations I had about it but mostly because of the sub-par execution. I got the game as part of a bundle and perhaps I could recommend it then for hardcore fans of the walking simulator genre, but at full price I'd advise consumers to look someplace else.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'This Action-FPS game was released back in November, 2007. But at the time it had some of the best graphics ever for a game of its kind! The main reason behind this was the kickass-German made Crytek engine that used a heavy demand on graphics cards at the time to present lots of new features. Does crytek sound familiar at all? if it does-that is because they also created the first far cry game waay back in 2004!\\nThese kinds of games typically have big expanses of various maps and consists of stealth missions near the start and middle sections but blooms into a beautiful action-set experience with lots of options! (Even some optional quests!). Crysis was no different and delivered a great action game with many new useful features/gameplay mechanics that more than made up for simpified story sequences, crappy nano-suit power (It is the damn future!) and some really dumb AI.\\nAnyway i dont want to list everything this game offers here! instead ill chop it into clean little pieces and serve you....The Pros and Cons.\\n+SO many awesome small little additions to gameplay that make a big difference! Some of these include: Your PC\\'s battery level shown, lots more graphics and weapon options at the time, Minimap accuracy with coordinates,  enhanced physics and a deadly shark to stop people from leaving the map! A frickin shark!!\\n+I really liked the Abilities FOR the nanosuit, but not the Nanosuit itself (Because of numerous energy reasons that ill describe in Cons below) The Cloak, Speed and Strength are used regularly, and for good reason!\\n+The Story is very strong and warhead fits in very well. The Title really fits the plot! and the \"Futuristic spelling\" helps a little bit too i guess. No Purposeful emotional scenes or anything  like that, its an action game dammit!\\n.But the story has got some great seperation between the stealth and action sequences! A calm cutscene to recap what big event just occured, followed by a guerilla-style trespass on an enemy base is a great mix! Basicsally what im trying to say is that the Pacing in this game is very well done.\\n+The Vehicles\\nhandle very well surprisingly and are easy to control, speaking of that...\\n+The tutorial is hardly a tuturial and just a slow part of the story that just happens to teach you the controls. Which are simple and very easy to change! (Loads of settings means more gameplay styles to suit more people=potential larger audience)\\n+Map is big and cut into sections, but that doesnt really matter as you traverse most of the area with ease. Missions take you to several different locations\\nDont classify this as an open world game at all! It is very linear like Basically all FPS shooters. It just has a big map for a few missions then changes it for a smaller, denser one And Repeats often.\\n+Weapons are quite realistic and have noticeable effects with mixed with the nano-suits abilities! Bullpup rifles will have more recoil than the generic AK-47 found often and it will effect your aiming long distance!\\n+The Way the Story transforms into the action packed shooter with various sci-fi elements attatched it amazing! If you asked me at the start of the game how i thought it would end, i would give a very different answer. But this is good! It means that the story will keep you guessing often while it introduces new Things to you.\\n+I couldnt talk about the pros without mentioning the Graphics that it possesses, it is has lots of technical features that i could fill the list with but instead ill give you this\\nBasically with mods it can run at 8k 60fps and all that good stuff. But remember this is extremely specific to most people. Depends if you care enough about it to mod the games really. But without it, it is definetely impressive\\n+Enemies are difficult at times, and can be placed in such environments to even give some peope a fright!\\n+Speaking of Difficulty...Try Delta! it really changes the game and makes you appreciate corners and baricades more than parts of the environment!\\n-Below-average boss battles, with repetitive strategies to defeat them.\\n-The AI in this game is quite dumb and found some soliders running into walls, ignoring me throwing grenades and even firing their guns randomly! (Who are they recruiting?).\\n-The games \"maps\" are surprisingly linear as i said above and you are contantly reminded of this if you go slight too far away from the beach, or from a checkpoint, etc.\\n-Nanosuit is so Underpowered. The features are great and well thought out, but due to the double A batteries of the suit most of the abilities run out after about 5-10 seconds! Running is definetely the worst offender, because it is one of the most useful mechanics in the game (And would have made speedrunning quite easy!) it is just sapped away by the energy so quickly! This might not seem too important to some people, but remember if you are in a fire-fight with enemies and you just used a different Ability (eg.Cloak-Mode) your energy will be sapped and if you need to make a inhumanly-quick escape...you can see where this is going.\\n-Most of the Map is just jungle with beach attatched! it gets so boring after a little while and you always look for a car to drive quickly to the next location because you dont want to take a slow walk and \"Enjoy\" whats on offer. Because there really isnt much! although it may look very beautiful and all, it is not dense at all (Full with structures or unique features) much like Just Cause 1, 2 and 3! Although this is a linear shooter at the end of the day, it feels like in some sequences, its trying to awkwardly change that!\\n-Lots of Glitches (Obviously! no game is perfect..) that affect the game\\'s graphics and also a crappy save system which, although being very manual to the player, has a very irritating habit of saving before a big battle. Now what would happen if you arrived early to said battle and were already taking lots of damage? Maybe an explosion happens at the last second? Save System: \"Go Back 30 mins  to the slow-stealth section please!\"\\n-Many minor parts of gameplay, controls or even visual effects will obviosuly be beaten by games today. So Ignorant players expecting a Battlefield 4 style Combat system will obviously not recieve it (The Combat/Weapon system and variety develops heavily in the second game!). Not really a Con, more of a \"warning\". But people know what they can expect now cant they!\\nI give this game a\\nIf you even remotely enjoyed Far Cry 1 or even 2, you will love the version with Aliens, futuristic weapons, and various Gameplay Tweaks.\\nfor Anyone who likes FPS games in general, Expansive Areas and Sci-Fi Elements.',\n",

I\\'m on the middle of Act II as of now, but since the constantly stellar experience that I have since I start my journey, I have a clear picture of what I think about this amazing game.\\nPillars of Eternity is an isometric CRPG, devveloped by Obsidian, the same studio who made Fallout New Vegas, Knights of  the Old Republic 2, and Neverwinter Nights 2 (among others). If you have played, one of their game, you already know what to expect. Yes, a deep RPG mechanic, with excellent writing, reactive world, and freedom of action to bend the world as you will. Give Obsidian freedom, free from the existing storyline, gameplay mechanic from previous game (since they usually make sequels), and \"pushy\" publisher, and what do you get? It\\'s Pillars of Eternity, an excellent game, made from scratch, with no \"restriction\" whatsoever, It feels like a game that Obsidian was itching to make from the start, a well realized, polished, ambitious, and nostalgia-fueled (for the better). It\\'s Obsidian\\'s best work so far, at least for me. Let\\'s get more in depth to the individual aspect of this game.\\nRich, engaging, moving, and intriquing lore with believable characters. Coupled with a brilliantly written texts and dialogues. A very well paced story where the mystery, back story, and overall lore are slowly revealed over time. Every thing is revealed in the right place, right time, and right amount of it, making the story progression feels ever so intriguing and natural.  A ton of equally superb side quest, that adds even more interesting story behind the land of Eora, and especially Dyrwood, with twist and turns along the way, making it a really great read.\\nIt\\'s an isometric CRPG, akin to Baldur\\'s Gate and Icewind Dale, if you\\'re into those kind of games, you will be feel right at home. It\\'s a deep modern RPG, something that has been lost for a decade. An RPG where the number matters, every aspect of the stats matters, and when you\\'re trying to be a jack-of-all-trades, the game will punish you. Not that it\\'s not achieveable though, in fact PoE offers a myriad of different ways to solve a quest. Stealth, frontal assault, backdoor assault, sweet talking, being diplomatc, deceit, it\\'s your choice. And no, you don\\'t get XP from combat, that shows that Obsidian wants you to know that combat can be avoided.\\nOne of the most praise-worthy thing to note on PoE is how it can streamline a complex RPG rule set and mechanic by giving a more straightforward explanation and neat, customizable UI. Both a simplified information of each aspect of the game and an extensive, more detailed manual are there for you to read and learn, in addition of a very customizable difficulty settings.\\nThe depth of this game can be seen even right on the character creation. You get to choose the race, class, birth place, background, and belief/motivation. Each with their own play style, advantage-disadvantage, and special abilties that you can mix and match ranging from the tried and true formula to the experimental one. My first character only lasts 2 hours because I underestimate the importance of those, and ended in an unsatisfying note, the second time (my current one), I  spent around 1 hour, reading back and forth the manual. and learning all those stats, so I can create a character that fits my play style.\\nThe combat is a blend between real time and \"turn-based\". Well, technically it\\'s a real time one where you can pause anytime to issue command to your party. It\\'s the perfect gameplay mechanic for this game where it can show both the complexity and chaotic nature of PoE. Use trap, ambush, sneak attack, and pretty much everything, PoE has multiple ways to deal with your foes. Dealing multiple effects to the enemy even before combat, you can paralyze, sicken, burn, stuck, frightened a single target, yes, poor lad. It has a flexible rule, and doesn\\'t hold back as long as it\\'s still in the realm of it\\'s rule set.\\nAnd then there\\'s the party system. The mechanic itself is your standard party system, up to 6 party members where you can recruit and dismiss. One thing that set it apart is the amazing back story, and personal side quest for each character, and the fact that they are so well crafted, that no one is overpowering anyone, they\\'re diverse, but equal.. Add unique personality, funny banter every once in a while, you\\'ll get a set of memorable and entertaining party system. Oh, and you can customize your own party, like Icewind Dale, where you can fully determine how they looks, their background, role, and their set of skills. They are not as interesting as the pre determined ones, but still a very nice addition if you want to have a complete freedom of how you play the game.\\nStronghold is a great feature, though underdeveloped. There\\'s nothing better than seeing your stronghold grow from a haunted ruin to a place where you can rest, hire adventurers, trading outpost, and a safe haven for travellers. But it\\'s nothing more than that, except the mysterious mega dungeon below it. By the time I write this review, the 3.0 patch is released, and it contains improvement on the Stronghold mechanic. This is one of the section where I will revise in the future, So yeah, there\\'s that for the momen.\\nArt direction, art style, atmosphere, and level design over polycount and how detailed the grass looks, anytime, any day. Graphically, if you mean graphic by the latter, Pillars of Eternity looks dated, OK-ish, IF you do a close up to the character, so does the animation. But, who plays this game on close ups? Pillars of Eternity (and traditional RPG in general) is meant to be played in a farther camera position, widen your field of view, and seeing the beautiful scenery that Obsidian has created. Ah yes, I can\\'t get enough of the scenery, it\\'s an excellently made interactive painting. Every place has their own feels, atmosphere, and personality, strong enough that you know what\\'s going on in that particular place. Creating a world, that is both beautiful when it described on text with a visual representation that can match, and complment it.\\nIt\\'s one of those games that  has an OST which are so great that I care to listen it on YT or through the game files afterwards. The voice acting is also top notch, when there is one. And the effect sounds are great too. It\\'s all around a fine one.\\nPillars of Eternity is a  must have for anyone looking for a \"traditional\", 90\\'s RPG, that is modernized and streamlined in all the right way. It\\'s deep, unforgiving, rewarding, immersive, and intense. A brilliant writing, solid mechanic, an art style that has a lot of personality on it, reactive world where your choice really matters, even if it\\'s just a minor one, side quests that has variety, quality, and quantity, and flexible mechanic that give the player a lot of play style choices, in which you can find a lot of replay value in this one.',\n",

The Lightning Gun is gone, The Assault rifle switched out for a pistol (The assault rifle had a grenade launcher as well), The Mine Launcher and grenade launcher were good for objective based games and the Translocator was the best way to get around the map and even used to tele-frag people....\\n[-]Adrenaline combos are gone! Why?! They were the best thing in the game. They offered special abilities like speed, invisibility, extra health and extra damage. You had to collect adrenaline around the map which encouraged exploration...\\n[-]No assault game mode?! I'm not even mad at this point, I'm just disappointed.\",\n",

These are just barebones horde mode with some flavour text, a predetermined loadout, and a mixture of three possible objectives. We can hunt for samples by killing enemies, collect five briefcases from all over the map, or hold designated spots for 10 seconds before moving along. Calling this repetitive is a mild understatement. It is boring, lazy, and can be even frustrating: ammo is often scarce by design, and some challenges want us to complete three different objectives in a row, where failing one puts us back to the very start.\\nAdmittedly, Umbrella Corps is not the world’s worst third-person shooter, but it ranks high up there. It is now a symbol of how low Resident Evil can sink, but maybe it also represents the rock bottom the series can never reach again.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Is the master criminal known as the Raven actually dead, or has he (or she!) returned to strike again? At first glance, this seems like your ordinary mystery/heist story in adventure game form. It starts off as an Agatha Christie homage aboard the Orient Express, and later an Agatha Christie homage on a boat to Cairo, but it turns into something so much better. For the first half of the game (which is in three separate chapters), you play as Constable Zellner, a Swiss policeman who loves mystery books and thus inserts himself into the mystery unravelling around him. He\\'s basically the most likable character in the world, and is like your favorite old uncle who slips you a twenty and tells you not to tell your parents. You follow him through jewel heists and murders, investigating alongside the detective who supposedly killed the Raven years ago--or did he? Then, right at the story\\'s climax halfway through, where normally you would get the big exposition dump about how it was all done, you instead actually jump to the start of the game and get to replay the story\\'s events as thte thieves. You get to see all the weird unexplained details that you revealed as the constable and begin to understand what was really going on the whole time. There are twists and turns even when you know what was going to happen during the flashback playthrough, which keeps it interesting. It finishes with a pretty satisfying ending.\\nSo, the good and the bad.\\nThe good: EXCELLENT music, which is very cinematic. It might as well have been the score from Death on the Nile or any other good detective movie. GREAT characters. You interact with a small group of characters, with new ones added along the way, and you get to interact with them and slowly learn their stories. These aren\\'t NPCs that you never learn their names or don\\'t care about them . The voice acting is likewise EXCELLENT. The story is entertaining.\\nThe bad: The animation is not great. A couple of the character models are plain creepy (one lady\\'s smile is 90% teeth). Shadows are off frequently, not fantastic lip-syncing. The backgrounds and scenery are fantastic (in one scene, they even animated the little dust particles in a beam of light from a window) but the characters compared to it are awkward. The character motion is often annoying, as characters will move to a spot when you interact with an object and often get stuck and turn around or shimmy several times to try to get into a spot blocked by local geometry. It\\'s frustrating to watch. Also, there is a \"fast forward\" function when you are going to a new area that is SUPPOSED to allow you to cut away from the chraracter walking to that area, but it didn\\'t work 70% of the time, and I had to watch as these characters walked horribly slowly to the next scene. There is also a puzzle in Chapter 3 where there are 3 WRONG orders to put together some items, and only 1 right order. If you do the wrong order, the character simply won\\'t do what you need them to, and there\\'s no way to undo the steps you already did. I got stuck and had to redo the entire chapter from the beginning because the autosave didn\\'t put me far enough back in the story to get around the glitch. Save often! Don\\'t rely on autosave!\\nOverall, if you like Agatha Christie-like mysteries, jewel heists, great characters, point-and-click adventure games, or all of the above, you should definitely play this game. It\\'s glitches and less-than-stelllar character models/animations are easily ignored for this story.',\n",

It is relaxing and there is some light humour sprinkled in. The sound design is amazing. All the sounds are made by mouth. The graphics are only black and white but thats alright since there are A LOT of moving things on the screen, you might feel overwhelmed at first but luckily you are given hints on where to find what you are looking for. Overall it was an  enjoyable experience abeit short (though they say ingame they are working on new areas). I definitely recommend this game',\n",

       "  'text': \"Honestly it pains me to do this.\\nZeboyd Games has a reputation for really grabbing the unholy trinity of RPGs: Interesting premise, well constructed gameplay, and dirt cheap price. In the finale of Rain-Slick, they pull off one and a half. While the game retains its bizarre unpredictable environment, fast-paced action, humorous writing, and gains a killer soundtrack, it overstays its welcome rather quickly. Which sucks considering this is the longest game in the series.\\nEarly on you're introduced to the UnderHell, which fits considering the fact that virtually everything is unoriginal and dull to walk through. The enemies are as creative as ever but it's horribly boring to go through, which sucks since one of the aims was to give the game a more epic scale with the addition of a world map. The job pin system is also replaced with a party of four different monsters ranging from a bro rodent - or brodent - to a living vending machine, which hits and misses. Similarly to the job pin system of the last game, each monster has its own playing style, but none really match up to the rather impressive ideas that came from the mundane made awesome job system, which in case you forgot, weaponized shoemaking and planted gardens that caused various effects as time passed. Ultimately they play very simularly. The difficulty ramps up nicely as well and offers a good deal of challenge as time goes on, which is nice, though early game feels very simple.\\nUltimately, Rain-Slick 4 just motivated me with the desire to play 3 again since I had a much better time with it. While this game offered a great amount of unpredictable moments, it's much more predictable. If this was 3 it'd be running around in circles, then as you thought it would keep running it'd do a backflip or start talking in an incomprehensible language, or randomly combust. 4 just keeps running, sometimes changing speeds and direction but it's still moving and you know it's going to move. This works out for it somewhat well as endgame is a lot more predictable compared to 3's endgame coming near out of nowhere, and it finishes very strong too. It's just a lot of the middle faultered greatly.\\nI recommend this game if you want to see the conclusion of the Rain-Slick series, are looking for a somewhat enjoyable RPG to play, or just enjoy Zeboyd Games' games. I mean it's cheap, you really can't beat that.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'More disclosure from me. I may be the world\\'s worst platform puzzle gamer. I am absolutely terrible at these things. So going into \"Papo y Yo\" I was a little hesitant but the great reviews and the relatively short gameplay time had me thinking \"why not\". \"Papo y Yo\" is the story of a boy named Quico dealing with an abusive alcoholic father. While hiding in the closet he sees a chalk mark on the wall and ends up falling into a dream like world and for the next 3-4 hours you\\'ll be traversing this world in order to find someone or something to help you cure the Monster (AKA your father\\'s demons). I really enjoyed this game. The game world was incredibly cool and the soundtrack was excellent. The gameplay is standard puzzle platforming but other than a couple frustrating moments this wasn\\'t difficult at all, even for a rank amateur like me.  Some might take issue with the game length but I found it perfect. The pacing was excellent and there wasn\\'t a lot of time wasted. The game wasn\\'t perfect. I did come across a bug or two that would screw up a couple of jumps here and there and the gameplay variety was a little lacking (pulls this, push that etc.). Some may also find the game a bit pretentious (the monster = Quico\\'s dad, frogs = alcohol) but it didn\\'t bug me at all and I found \"Papo y Yo\" to definitely be a journey worth taking. 8=10 from me.',\n",

As the puzzles are not generated randomly, you could just look up the solutions online, or click randomly to beat them.\\nThe music in this game is very nice, and is pretty \"zen\".\\nThe graphics are very nice and minimalist, however there is a glaring bug in the game. When you hover over cells, they \"wiggle\". This is a nice addition, however sometimes the wiggle is enough to let you see what is underneath, which ruins the point of using logic.

Finding the discrepancies between the documents can be quite engaging at times, as you have to make sure that they follow the rules that are set out. Following these rules such as remembering what is and what is not allowed, stamping documents can be challenging and for the first time possibly overwhelming, however the more you play the easier it gets and you will have a better experience.

       "  'text': 'My favorite MMORPG so far, Champions Online has a wonderful action oriented combat system with crunchy character bulding, stat management and power selection systems that allow a detailed player to build something extra potent! \"Be the Hero you want to be!\"\\nCO also has a wonderful Free to Play option that takes out about 90% of that complexity and thus serving as an excellent hand holding introduction to the funnest elements of the gameplay without the harder stat managing aspects, which some players such as myself love, but some don\\'t. It\\'s definitely easier to learn the basics of the game with.\\nAn adaptation of the Tabletop RPG Champions, Champions Online is a 2009 Super Hero MMORPG offering a wide variety of power and costume customisation options. While the storylines and environments are usually an Homage to a Silver Age style, light-hearted and brightly-coloured, occasional Bronze Age consequences and morals are hinted at. Player characters display a wide range of styles, from The Cape through The Cowl to the Nineties Anti-Hero.\\nVarious departures from the Pen & Paper game are noticeable, including the absence of the concept of acquiring character flaws in order to gain extra points. However, there is a lot more power growth compared to the Pen and Paper experience.\\nThe intellectual property rights to the Champions setting are now held by Cryptic Studios (themselves owned by Perfect World Entertainment), the original developers of the MMORPG City of Heroes. They bought the setting outright rather than licensing it. The IP is licensed back to the original developers (who still own the underlying Hero System) for the Champions pen-and-paper game.\\nAs a Superhero MMO with a sense of humour about itself, there are numerous references to other works. It features just about everything on the list of comic book tropes.\\nAs of January 2011 it is free to play, downloadable from its website; later in June it came to Steam along with a few other such games. Another fairly notable update came in the form of \"On Alert\" in April of 2012, which changed the logo, made more content available to everybody (and with it added more premium content) and added the titular alert system. The alert system is effectively a new type of mission, and one of several ways to gain the resource questionite, which can be used directly to buy some things, or traded player-to-player in an stock exchange type system for the cash store\\'s currency, at this point Perfect World\\'s ZEN.(In addition, several missions and bosses which were already present were edited to reward questionite—including the adventure packs, which as of that update became free for all.) In late 2012, vehicles were introduced, becoming a customizable feature in December with the Reloaded update.',\n",

The graphics aren\\'t horribly retro, but carefully crafted, everything feels like it belongs together. Most important platforms look like they should while spikes look nasty and dangerous, so none of your inevitable deaths are caused by not knowing where you can land.\\nSound is atmospheric, with a minimum of voice acting, which is well done, and the professional quality helps keep you in the game.\\nThe difficulty level is tough, but fair. experienced platform players will feel comfortable, while new guys will hopefully learn to watch for clues early on.\\nIf you have even a passing interest in platform games, or you\\'re just curious about how we used to game back in the day, this is the one to look at.\\nIt\\'s a great game at the price, and if you see it at a discount, get it for sure.',\n",

The guns are all unique and feel great -- a nailgun that can pin people to walls like ragdolls? A particle beam cannon that leaves nothing but the skeletal remains of a foe in a pool of blood? Hell yes. Also of note is the enemy A.I.: it's still some of the best I've seen in any shooter to date. Lastly, and most obviously, F.E.A.R. is pretty spooky. Sometimes it's cheap, Doom 3, Jack-in-the-box scary, but sometimes it's very effective scripted psychological horror. One second, you're in the a hallway that looks just like the last five you've been through, and the next second you're in a burning hospital coated in blood with a little girl yelling at you. It's just scary enough to put you on edge, but not scary enough to make you feel like going to bed with a cross and a stake.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Little Nightmare is an interesting little indie horror / thriller game, similar to LIMBO or INSIDE. The plot is murky and difficult to grasp, which leaves room for imagination in the world of yellow-raincoated Six and the vessel in the sea. The game is very dark and atmospheric and contains (easy-to-solve) little puzzles for the player to try to beat. Visuals are detailed and the art style seems fitting to the mood of the game. Audio and sounds are fun too.\\nUnfortunately, there were more than a few occasions where keyboard controls proved to be glitchy. This kind of unresponsive and unpredictable behavior caused many deaths, because Six got stuck in objects I didn't point her to move at. Newcomers to genre should be warned, the game is very linear.\\nOverall, it's a very solid game and an easy recommend for fans of the genre. There is about 5 hours of playtime.\",\n",

The decore and technology all look like something from that era.\\nInteresting progression system requiring you to complete acts of infamy.\\nEasy to mod. Just unpack files and change values.\\nHandful of unique henchman that you can directly control and have special abilities.\\nA nice comedic take on some things. Interogations involves smashing their heads between symbols and spinning them in an office chair so it's not gruesome. Minions will stupidly work themselves into a coma, and if low enough on stats will even walk into your bases traps.\\nYou can kill your minions to motivate the rest of them. Pretty wicked.\\nA good variety of rooms and limited space makes planning a good idea.\\nCons:\\nBasically needs to be modded or it's painful to play on many levels.\\nOnly 3 evil geniuses, and the wiki says maximilians passive bonus to research was never even added.\\nBodies of agents you kill take forever to rot and drain your minions loyalty as they sit there, you can store them in the freezer to stop it but space is limited and they take twice as long to decay in there.\\nConstant assualt from agents of justice constantly destroying your stuff, breaking your doors down, and robbing you. You end up having to kill them which leads right into the body bag issue and increases your head sending more agents.\\nThe biggest rip off ever, you make extra security doors, and put traps around your base and agents just climb up through the ♥♥♥♥ing floor. One of the agents in my game crawled up in an in-accessable area of the room because there were gold bars blocking the path so she'd just shoot at people walking buy.\\nMoney gain is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and painfully slow, you have to stick minions in the world map to steal funds but as they're there they get picked off by the local law enforcement and you only get the rewards for your efforts every 2 minutes or something like that.\\nBasically the game has a great premise, I'd like to see it done with a bit more to it. I modded my game to make it more playable. Made money from world map collect every 20 seconds instead of 2 minutes (still takes quite a while since your agents will get wrecked by the local police). I made it so bodies increased loyalty instead of decreasing it so they actually seem like EVIL minions and not random people who took the first job they could get. I made the freezer increase decay rates so I wouldn't have mounds of bodies piling up.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'TL;DR - Wait for AI Fixes before guying and supporting this game\\nFrom a veteran of 900+ hours of civ V... Too much.  Yeah, I know.\\nI\\'m going to try to keep this short and sweet.  I\\'m reading a lot of reviews about \"I don\\'t like the fog of war\", \"The victory conditions are not balanced\", or \"There\\'s not enough info on the tool tips\"...  While all this may be true, there is only one reason I would say do not buy this game -- The AI.\\nPros of the game\\n- I really like the new systems.  I may be in the minority here, but I like the housing, the amenities, the religion... Basically I like how everything that\\'s new works.  Great job Firaxis.\\n- Looks good.  Graphics are impressive.  Especially the sub missile launches.\\n- Bugs aren\\'t anything out of proportion with any other major studio release nowadays.  They are there, but nothing game breaking.\\nCons\\n- Tool tips and Civlopdeia.  I find myself searching the internet more often than checking the in-game info, because 99% of my questions just aren\\'t answered.  Not in the tutorial.  Not on the tooltips.  Not in the civlopedia.\\n- Techs and units feel simple and unfinished, especially late game units.  Like they ran out of time, and just shipped the game with the bare essentials.  Or there\\'s going to be an expansion with flushed out end game content and tech tress.\\n- Missing some obvious and simple bonehead functions.  Like removing a district you placed wrong.  \"Oh you misclicked where you wanted that district?  Sorry, It\\'s there forever.  Better let the AI take your city and hope they raise it if you want to place it 1 tile to the left so you can build that wonder that has very specific tile requirements!  Otherwise you\\'re F\\'d forever!!!\"\\n- General AI ability.  Civ VI\\'s AI feels nonsensical and half finished.  Like they took CIV V\\'s AI and put them in Civ 6 with no new instructions, no idea how to use the systems, no idea how to use builders to modify thier lands to improve thier output, no understanding of districts... They jsut gave them ridiculously large, non scaling and unbalanced AI bonuses to try and compensate for thier inability to use the built in sytems to play the game, along with unbending \"agendas\" that ruin all hope of having any semblence of a responsive interaction with the AI.\\nThe main problem with the AI, is it\\'s not fun to play them.  It feels super primitive, with a one size fits all approach.  I can see where maybe the planned to go with the AI, if they do a major patch or rework, I think there\\'s potential for the AI to be better than CIV V, but right now, it\\'s a long way from there, and frankly, I\\'m writing this review, because I\\'m not even sure I want to start a 3rd game.\\nSad, isn\\'t it?',\n",

       "  'text': \"I can't say I didn't enjoy Fran Bow, but as a story based game it leaves a bad taste in my mouth with writing decisions which leave too much room for speculations.\\nWhat I enjoyed: It's set in a very well designed world with lots of loveable and relatable characters. It's kind of weird though how the game plays out. It's supposedly a horror game, but it's barely functioning as one. The game incorporates a lot of peaceful and likeable characters and enviroments, which is very rare, but it's not a concept which can't work, and here it kind of does. With this it's easy to make a huge contrast so it's shocking elements have a bigger effect. Using this, the game switches between dark and happy themes a few times to make a world which may as well be Fran's disturbed mind, and it's presented with a gorgeous art style. Also, for the most part the writing is good, but unfortunately when it matters the most they failed to make something interesting.\\nIt's hard to talk about what I don't like about this game without spoiling anything. So for those of you who don't want it to get spoiled, the game's story is written in a way that when you get answers it only raises more questions. And in the end you get so much♥♥♥♥♥♥thrown at you (trying to explain what exactly happened) that it's not only overwhelming, but feels like a very heedless way to fininsh a game. Everything which happens in the last like 10 minutes is just a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and I don't mean it in a way that it's completely unlikeable, there were moments which were great and memorable, but outside of that it's really just a rushed way to try and tighten up loose ends, but it just couldn't do that with all of them.\\nSo yeah, it's hard to explain what I didn't like, but all in all it was a pleasant experience.\",\n",

It\\'s like it is trying to make the point that it\\'s not about button mashing or picking the \"strongest\" character. Well...congratulations, dive kick: you proved it. But did it really take an entire GAME for it? :-\\\\\\nIt\\'s probably pretty fun in a local multiplayer (which I haven\\'t tried), but let\\'s be honest: nearly all games are. And this game looks only slightly more complex than a rock-paper-scissors game. Yes, I\\'m sure it has plenty of depth if you take timing, reflexes, tactical movement and such into account...but everything being so bareboned means that there\\'s little incentive to explore. I mean...I finished the campaign in less than half an hour.\\nThe voices are sort of funny, but it gets old. Visuals are...I\\'d say \"okay\", but I\\'ve gotta say that even by Indy standards, I\\'ve seen plenty better. Characters are dull and uninteresting as well, but with just two buttons you can\\'t really argue on that.\\nAll in all...meh.

       "  'text': \"DISCLAIMER: It's been awhile since I played this game and I am finally getting around to reviewing it. I put off reviewing it for so long because it's such an odd game and I didn't know what to say about it. Anyway, the point is that I am going off of my faulty memory.\\nI liked this game but it's not for everyone. It's really hard to pin down. It plays like the graphical adventure games of olden days--King's Quest, Police Quest, Space Quest, etc. except you don't really collect items in an inventory, neither do you really solve any puzzles. It almost feels like a surreal text adventure populated with quirky characters but with some impressionistic graphics and haunting music to go along with it. It's like a game that Sierra On-Line would have made back in the day, if David Lynch and William Faulkner had worked there.\\nThe game feels more like a tone poem. It's eerie at times, but not scary. It can be hauntingly beautiful at times, leaving you feeling melancholy. Sometimes it can be weirdly comical. As I said before, you don't really solve any major puzzles and you only occasionally feel like you are pursuing any sort of goal or are part of any story that is advancing toward any kind of resolution. You sort of go along for the ride and you do have decisions to make, but those are mostly just selecting dialog. The gameplay, what little there is, feels like mostly just adding some subtle nuance to the way the characters interact with each other.\\nLooking back over what I wrote, it can seem like I am being negative about the game, but I can say that it was a very unique experience and I thought that the presentation, however odd, was enjoyable. If you want to try something really different, I suggest you give this game a shot when it goes on sale.\",\n",

Stealth is enjoyable, armor makes you feel badass, and some of the weapons were just plain awesome.\\nMy main complaint is the voice acting. Some of the characters *cough* Gould *cough* didn't sound very convincing, and at several times throughout the game the audio clips didn't match up to what was happening. Also, some guns are basically useless on higher difficulties, and on the flipside this game throws in too many (in my opinion) HMGs for you to use.\\nDon't even try it if you don't have a good computer.\\nThis game is a beast.\\n85/100\",\n",

What\\'s better is that each type (color) of ghost has a special behavior, so you know what they\\'ll try to do as you approach. If you can swerve accordingly, gaining points, power-ups, etc, I imagine the maze is infinite.\\nThe power-ups are fun, though some are definitely better than others. You can pick up coins in the maze, and earn bonus coins for completing missions (and earn random coin \"gift\" boxes) that you can spend on leveling up your power-ups. The power-ups have a limited time that can be extended by eating other power-up pellets, in order to chain your power-up to make it last as long as possible. Though the easiest to \"chain\" is the original Power-Pellet because you also gain extra time for eating ghosts (whereas the other power-ups \"kill\" them).\\nI can\\'t recommend this game enough.

       "  'text': 'Enclave is a 2002 action game from Starbreeze studios, the studio that went on to develop Chronicles of Riddick, The Darkness, and even Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. The first few steps of a storied team.\\nYour first mistake will be to think that this is a roleplaying game in the slightest. It is not. Campaigns are divided into an odd 13 missions (14 for Light), and you begin each one by picking a class and loadout. Collecting gold within levels only increases the amount you can purchase with your persistent loadout.\\nThis was originally intended as a multiplayer experience, perhaps even solely multiplayer, and it shows. From \"You are leaving the mission\" messages when you stray too far from the intended game arena, to several \"Capture the Castle\" missions left wholesale in the Dark Campaign.\\nFor the most part this isn\\'t actually a bad thing. It lends itself positively in some other areas - the variety of playstyles is appreciated, and the open-ended levels (whilst obviously meant to accommodate multiple players) make the levels infinitely more interesting than if they were linear. This has all the trappings of a typical Pandemic title in a single-player only package.\\nHowever, your second mistake is to buy this game, because it\\'s terrible.\\nIt\\'s a real letdown that it is. The graphics are nice - much better than the screenshots let on, with some of the Dark Campaign levels being outright beautiful. The character models are comparable to Fable\\'s in quality and art direction, both of which have aged very well, and even the OST is excellent, with battle music and environmental shifting out of each other seamlessly.\\nThough the VA is terrible (narrators aside), it\\'s endearingly so, with exaggerated movements to make up for their lack of emoting that only early 3D titles could provide.\\nEnclave is terrible because it plays terrible.\\nMelee is a wet fish slapping affair, madly bashing the single attack button as you desperately play footsies in a sad display that makes QWOP look elegant, and ranged will see you backpeddle through entire levels as you fish for headshots (along with some hopelessly onesided shootouts against the lazer-sighted AI), In both cases, the hitboxes are completely shot, with both melee and ranged strikes regularly phasing through opponents. Even when you do connect, don\\'t expect any hitstun as you continue dancing like a puppet held by a Parkinson\\'s patient, because this is still a multiplayer title in all but name,\\nIt\\'s a disgrace that makes shovelware indie titles look good by comparison. You feel like you\\'re compensating for lag that isn\\'t there, trying to play by the rapidly shifting rules of this broken shoddy gameplay.\\nYou shouldn\\'t buy this game, and I don\\'t recommend it. Not because of the \"aging graphics\", or the pricetag, or even the single save file that gets annoying when your Dark Campaign overwrites the unlocks of your Light Campaign, but because even when compared to its contemporaries, it is an absolute nightmare to actually play.\\nEnclave, a sloppy start to a long career, belongs to the annals of time. You should move on to greener pastures.',\n",

DO NOT PLAY MULTIPLAYER ON THIS GAME. it will break your computer. it gave me internet problems where i disconnected from my router yet my brothers laptop could connect 100% fine compared to mine. EVEN IF I WASNT PLAYING MW2, IT STILL RANDOMLY DISCONNECTS MY INTERNET FOR NO REASON, AT LEAST ONCE PER 25-30 MINUTES. i had to uninstally and reinstall my internet and ethernet drivers and it STILL did not completely fix the problem, even though it helped a bit.\\n2. it also broke my computers headset support so my headset that worked 100% perfectly fine before playing the game would not work at all. back to the internet problems, being in a skype or teamspeak call for too long while playing ANY game not just MW2 would also make me lose connection automatically after about a minute.\\n3. I EXPERIENCED NONE OF THESE PROBLEMS BEFORE HAVING THIS GAME, AND EVEN AFTER UNINSTALLING IT, NONE OF THE PROBLEMS WERE FIXED. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.\\n4. My brothers friend who is pretty good with Computers says my last alternative will be to freaking uninstall and reinstall windows 10 tomorrow and we will see if that will fix anything.\\n5.

       "  'text': 'Heavy Bullets is a Rogue-Like FPS where you have one objective: Get to the end of the security mainframe to stop machines and creatures from killing the clients of your company, and yourself.\\nIt\\'s a very simple game. You are armed only with a Revolver, and you need to survive the 8 levels of the hunting grounds where various creatures and machines lie about to kill you. Your revolver can kill everything in one hit, and is 100% dead accurate. There\\'s no bullet time travel, it instantly hits whatever you point at. You only have 6 bullets though, so you need to pick your bullet back up, and reload it back into your gun (Which is also instant with a press of the R key.)  Enemies will stop at nothing to chase you once they have you in your line of sight, but they drop coins which you can use to buy various items.\\nMany items and stations exist to help you along the way. Lots of items are hidden throughout the floors, or locked away in doors that require keycards (Which you get from killing certain enemies), so you should do some searching around the area, you might find something good. You have items that bring up passive effects such as taking one hit without losing health, resistance to explosions, or a backpack for additional storage; or they can be weapon items such as mega bombs, mines, or rockets. Other items are handy tools. Speaking of storage, you can only hold one item at a time, so you need to make your choices carefully when you have to pick from 2 or more items, unless you have the backpack, then you can hold two items.\\nThere are 3 stations: Banks are the most important ones. You can store your earned money into the bank for future use when you die, you can also store items in the bank for another run. You can withdrawl money from whatever you stored, and you can buy a last will, or life insurance which\\'ll transfer a percentage of your money on-hand to the bank when you die. There is also the Medbay station for healing items, and Bullets (And Stuff) for weapons and other weird little items.\\nThis game is permadeath, so if you die, you\\'re sent all the way back to the beginning, but there is the Bank station to help you out on your next run. It kinda brings a thought of \"should I store money in here now for better runs next time, or                    withdrawl some money from my current bank so I can have more help on this run?\" Same thing does for storing items, too. It\\'s a bit of decision making when you think about it, so be smart about what you do.\\nIt\\'s not an easy game, either. Everything (Besides immobile turrets) charge directly at you, and aren\\'t afraid to get in your face. You need to make your shots carefully because you only have so many bullets before you have to reload, so accuracy is a must for surviving large encounters. That means don\\'t freak out; keep a cool head. Making it all the way to level 8 and beating the boss will be quite the challenge.\\nOverall, Heavy Bullets is a pretty unique rogue-like with it\\'s fast paced nature of your insta-kill revolver, the metroidvania vibes of searching for items, and the strategic thinking of the bank and what items to bring with you. I think you\\'ll find quite a bit of enjoyment out of it, and it\\'s cheap too. It\\'s something to try out sometime.\\n7/10',\n",

If you have a fetish for that I\\'d recommend Indigo Prophecy, at least that one has AI gods, Aztec priests, and Necrophilia. This is just dull and sad.',\n",

       "  'text': \"When I bought this game I thought I was in for a fun and relaxing time. Little did I know I had signed up for hell. Albeit the first few levels are pretty straight forward and easy, the steep difficulty curve that swiftly follows out of nowhere is very hard to adapt to. That however is what keeps the game interesting to me. Being a completionist makes it hard for me to leave levels without completing all three of the objectives set out for me. This in turn is both infuriating and wonderful as it makes the replay value for each level much higher for me. I'll replay until I get all 3 stamps per level.\\nI can see why the game may not appeal to some. It isn't really a simulator. There really isn't all that management when it comes to funding of new trains and things like upgrades. The only thing you need to pay close attention to is changing the arrows on the tracks so that trains go to their correct stations and of course making sure you don't go bankrupt while you are crazily building tracks. There really isn't much micromanaging required to play this game. Avid simulation fans will be mad, avid casual gamers who like only a little bit of management so that the game doesn't tie them down for too many hours at a time will rejoice.\\nI personally, although annoyed by some levels because they are so damn hard to even complete for a first time, love this game. It's a fun way to kill a bit of time, it isn't too demanding unlike other simulations where you need to focus on a lot of different little things and it is really easy to pick up thanks to the simple mechanics.\\nOverall, for $10 it is worthwhile adding this game to your collection. Some may beg to differ as the change in difficulty pretty early into the game can make it seem uninteresting and even make it unplayable for some; but personally for me I think it is worth it. I get lots of replay out of it. It's a simple concept with easy controls and it is at times mentally challenging, causing myself to really think out my approach to each level. I personally enjoy a little bit of a challenge when playing games like this so if you feel much the same, I recommend it 100%\",\n",

       "  'text': 'This is a good game, a good iterative improvement on 2016, and I was having a great time with it, then the completely bogus lottery of Brexit reared it\\'s head. What on gods green earth were the developers thinking when they implemented this feature and a little easter egg in the game? Let me explain my situation, I started a game as Chelmsford City, my local team, I\\'m in the year 2022 in my game, and I\\'ve taken them to League One after losing in the Playoff to Wycombe last year. Anyway I was gearing up for a new promotion challenge with my admitedly limited squad, but I was feeling confident, and then Brexit strikes. At first I didn\\'t think much of it \"Players will require work permits, but existing players will be given special status to remain\", fair enough I thought, annoying, but I can tailor my future transfers around that, it shouldn\\'t effect me too much. Unfortunately this was a lie. Now, coming up to League One from a semi professional Vanorama South Club, money is understandably tight, as a result most of my players are on one or two year contracts, not a problem, they often renew quite happily, however it was a problem this time, because what the message above said was simply a lie. You might have heard of Toni Martinez, he\\'s a Spanish ex youth player from West Ham, he\\'s my main man at Chelmsford scoring 20+ goals the last two seasons, he\\'s been phenomenal. At the start of the season he was entering his last year, so naturally I renewed, I got him signed up to a new three year deal, he even took a paycut, what a guy. The problem is, as soon as he accepted the deal, he required a work permit.... pardon? I thought he had special status? Now, he failed to get that work permit, the rules were the same as South American work permits, as in needing international caps to be eligable. Now I don\\'t know about you, but the chances of a West Ham reject playing in League One getting games for the Spanish national team seems pretty low to me, and I\\'m sure this will be true of most nations, so in effect this change has made it impossible for anyone outside the top ten clubs in the country to purchase foriegn players, what the hell is that about? I have multiple EU players in my squad, with this change they\\'re all going to have to leave, despite the promise of special status from the Brexit message, frankly it\\'s flat out broke. I can\\'t really continue my game going forward now, I\\'ve got a player sitting on a massive wage (for my club) who I can do nothing with, and I have no money to adapt, and frankly I don\\'t feel compelled to play the game when this feature is so clearly broken, it\\'s a mess.\\nI\\'m going to rate this game no purely based on this feature, it\\'s a fun and interesting feature that lets you face the mutliple potential difficulties of Brexit, the feature itself isn\\'t the problem, it\\'s quite a nice one, the problem is that it\\'s snuck in under the carpet, it\\'s on by default and there is no obvious way of turning it off, you have to go into the editor to disable it, and once you\\'ve start the game you\\'re left utterly helpless. I now have a save which I\\'ve invested somewhere close to 100 hours in which is now unplayable due to a laughable implementation of a feature which has crippled my club, how on earth did this idea get past QA? I might be tempted to thumbs up if you guys will offer to fix my save, otherwise my options are to spend money on a dodgy saved game editor.\\nGG SI.',\n",

Also people have to keep in mind that company could care less about few lost customers, but if everybody who don\\'t like what\\'s going on in gaming industry these days keep distance away from toxic stuff, companies would have to change the way they handle bussiness.\\nSniper Elite V2 will take you deep to Germany inside ruined Berlin.

Go there, destroy this, go there, save this, go there, survive this, go there, kill this.

Choosing from strange and original races such as the mysterious Godlike and the large Auaran (spelling may be wrong on that one), to traditional dwarf, elf, and human races, and picking from classes that range from the familiar (Rogue, Paladin, Druid, Priest) to the unique (Chanter, Cipher), you\\'ll travel through the realm searching for answers, and utilizing a familiar, yet refreshingly tweaked, engine that made Baulder\\'s Gate so amazing.  Little things that make this game even more enjoyable like fast-walking (for those large walks across mazes of dungeons), Wizards and Priest being able to eventually become strong enough to cast spells per encounter instead of per rest, the ability to create additional party members to join you (in case you want a particular party makeup that the npc\\'s don\\'t provide, or you want a strong party until you find more of them) and reconstructing your very own stronghold are just a few of the things that make this more than just a \"clone\", but a strong game in its own right.\\nHighly recommended for fans of the genre.

       "  'text': \"( I've played all HL games so far in 2016, so no nostalgia involved)\\nHalf-Life 1 was okay/good.  I loved Opposing Forces  even more, and Half-Life 2 overall was even better, with some parts of the game not being that good. At the time of writing this review I haven't played the Episodes, so I don't really know info about them.\\nThe game starts with GMan telling you that there's stuff to do, and driven by free choice Gordon Freeman does whatever he wants, as long as he follows the corridor the game opens to him. Jokes aside, the game is a huge and long corridor. A very pretty and well done, well built corridor, but still, the game lacks choice and freedom - though it's not really a problem, as the game is action-driven, always happens something that forces you to go further. Attack from beind, tunnels collapsing, or they say the next goal is ahead of you.\\nAnd here's where one of the things come in the picture that made the game sooo much better for me that HL1 was - change of environment.  HL1 was in Black Mesa and in Xen, and while the two was vastly different, and the level design was great, you still spent most of your time between walls of BM.  On the other hand in HL 2 there are canals, sewers, city landscape, country-like environment, beach, cliffs, a mining town worthy of horror stories, Combine (aliens) base, and street warfare. Not only the level layout changed, but the style as well. Cities had snipers, zombies and headcrabs were abundant in abandoned places, while combine had most power in the city.  So type of the enemies, coupled with the different environments and available weapons at that point made the game really diverse, while it was really consistent, logical by building up that diversity.\\nThings I loved it in game:\\n- Finally a proper story with recurring characters, and not just random people telling me where to go and never seeing them again.  Actually the story was really enjoyable.\\n- Good weapon selection - they are different, and I think all weapons were useful in certain situations. While one can have a favourite weapon, there wasn't useless ones.\\n- Physics are just awesome. The ragdoll after hitting enemies with the crossbow, how explosions throw stuff around, and how *incredibly* well the gravity gun was implemented in the game. The gravity gun is basically a tech bragging from Valve to show off the physics, but instead of it being a show-weapon, they made lots and lots of situations where it was needed. In modern games a lots of new things are used only for a short period, here the Gravity Gun, the driveable buggy and airboat was used for quite a lot of time, G.G. for the most obviously\\n- Secrets, AKA Lambda-locations. They are not really useful if you're at least average with FPS games, as they only give ammo, health and ocassionally shields, but they balance out the game for people who are not too good at FPS, but pay attention to their surroundings. I personally love it when a game rewards you for discovery.\\nAnd the negative:\\n- Basically character collision. I finally meet Eli and Alyx, I'm just standing, staring at them talking and then Alyx just pushes me away. In SO MANY scripted moments they just push me away instead of properly avoiding me, and it was really, really annoying and immersion breaking.\\n-Character collision 2.0:  you and your squad.  I demand the rights to shoot those terrible soldiers who block eachother and me - they follow me, staying behind like 3-5 metres, and any time I have to go back they bump to me, to eachother, they pushes eachother away like domino pieces, and it's just superfun when a strider is shooting at me.\\n-Preposition? The game's start is really weird in my opinion. Climbing though a fence, going in a random house, then getting chased because... why? The game tries to show the Combine bad, so the player would rather flee from them (as lack of means to fight back) but in the game it's not even explained why they are there, and who they are. Which is really weird for me, and made me question the actions and happenings in the first few chapters.\\nThese are the only things I can't even grasp how they managed to leave in the game, I can't recall anything else more than mildly annoying.\\nGame is still a lot of fun today, and playing it absolutely made me realize how incredily powerful and useful the engine is, and why there are so many mods based on it - the game is fun:  varied enemies and weapons, there are often some mini-puzzles to solve to go further (like collecting 3 car batteries) make the game still a really enjoyable experience. I would recommend playing it if you want a better gameplay experience than a story  - the story is full with mysteries, but playing the game feels much more rewarding than most newer FPS games proved to be for me.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"EDIT: This is a Review of the beta (not the opt-in)\\nI have spent over 750 hours playing this game, therefore; I thought I would write a review in which I discuss the Pros and Cons concerning AAPG and then give my final verdict, so here goes...\\nPros:\\n+ Decent Graphics especially for a free to play game.\\n+ Teamwork and Collaboration are encouraged throughout the game.\\n+ The game's mechanics are way more improved than the previous AA titles.\\n+ Map editing is awesome!\\n+ It's Free! You don't need to spend a single dime on anything. You have everything unlocked right at the start.\\nCons:\\n- Uninspired maps, they are all extremely linear and basic with no variety of game modes (there's only two or three game modes depending on the size of the map).\\n- Bugs, Glitches, crashes, login problems, you name it! This game has it all.\\n- Ridiculous weapons, like the nerfed M16A4 (as well as the M14EBR) and the overpowered Boomstick (shotgun).\\n- Bad community (no offense to you dear readers). You will get kicked on purpose at random times just because you are bad or good at this game (especially in non-official servers).\\n- Lack of Realism.... IN AN AMERICA'S ARMY GAME!!\\n- Rank Progression is POINTLESS, you won't gain anything from ranking up. Ranks only determine a player's experience.\\n- Matchmaking is broken. Newcomers will often be put in a match against veterans that still play this game.\\n- The audio is extremely terrible. You can hear a man's footsteps from a mile away. Gunshots sound as if they're coming out from paintball guns.\\n-Lack of logic. A person can take numerous large rifle cartridges to the chest due to the poor hit detection yet he can still manage to put up a fight and kill several people in the process.\\n\\nIf you are looking for a realism experience, then stay away from this game. Go buy arma 3 or even Insurgency, heck I recommend trying out America's army 3 over this garbage. America's army proving grounds is a game that doesn't belong in the america's army franchise. If you don't know what I'm talking about, then I suggest trying out the game's predecessors which are far better than this one.\",\n",

The New Order is a perfectly functional FPS; if you are just looking for a new retro FPS to waste a few hours on, then you will probably have a good time. However, I cannot personally recommend this game because it offers nothing that I haven’t seen before in other FPS games. I was honestly bored throughout the majority of the gameplay, because it consisted of nothing but shooting enemies with weapons that were severely uncreative for a Wolfenstein game. The only thing that made me complete the game was the story, which is honestly a pretty enjoyable for how campy and over the top it is. It may seem like I’m being harsh on it, but with games like shadow warrior demonstrating what can be done with a modernised old school FPS, I was expecting more than an average shooter from Wolfenstein.',\n",

       "  'text': \"I'll get the obvious out of the way first - the art direction and music scoring for Ori is great.\\nUnfortunately, the actual gameplay could have used just as much attention.\\n--For starters with this game's problems, it falls into the same trap as many other games with gorgeous art - the scenery that won't kill you is nigh indistinguishable from the scenery that will. This is a big no-no.\\n--Secondly, while I appreciate the devs taking some risks and giving the player some unusual skill combinations, the Stomp skill is by far the WORST implementation of controls in any platformer. Accidentally hitting 'down' will send your character plummeting usually into a spike pit to their death.\\n--Another problem that games with lots of beautiful effects have is sometimes the screen gets too mulled by craziness to tell what is going on. Ori suffers from this, as well, when the spirit flame attack pretty much obstructs any enemy wind-ups; and there is a dodge/reflect mechanic that hinges on this ability to see incoming attacks.\\n--The temple escape scenes are all WRETCHED. Often times, the player will die a good few dozen times because it's unclear what is killing them or there are just tons of instant death elements that will ambigously kill the player. If you're really lucky, things that will hurt/kill you one moment you will need to use the dodge-bash mechanic on seconds later - BEST SCENARIO PLANNING EVAR (sarcasm). Especially in the case of the first dungeon, beat the rising water...except the water auto-rises in certain parts. So, no matter how well you are doing, the water is just going to raise to a certain mark once you reach a particular area and likely screw up any platforming you may have gotten a leg-up on by doing well. Why punish the player for excelling in your game?\\nAll in all, I feel you'd have to be a special sort of masochist to play through and enjoy Ori for what it is. I feel like they wanted to make a Lilo and Stitch meets Fern Gully animation, but decided to milk the gaming realm for cash instead. It has a pretty style, but also is a pretty bad game.\\nFinal edit - made it through to the end. It was not fun, mostly sloppy controls (can't exclusively use the D-pad due to the bash skill requiring the precision of the joystick during many jumping puzzles), and intentionally frustrating in the liberal use of instant death scenery that is ambiguously harmful to the player. I wish this team had hired a veteran game designer so these glaring errors wouldn't have made it into the final product. I'm glad my initial impressions were correct. Don't buy this garbage, although it is very pretty garbage.\",\n",

       "  'text': '+ fun campaign stories\\n+ nice building & unit variety\\n+ AoE look\\n+ XP system\\n+ fun multiplayer\\n+ two cool expansions\\n- simplified building & resource gathering\\n- home base cards\\n- the unit formations are useless\\n- lacks stuff that would make this game iconic like the first two\\nDo not be fooled by the hours played I have displayed here as I have played many many more. So to this date this is the last AoE games made. It has lots of new stuff and is very inovative from the first two...and yet...a bit boring compared to them. For some reason the developers simplified building stuff and gathering resources then they added home cards and reinforcements. At first it looked cool. But as you play it somehow distracts you, from the game, from the upgrades selectable in the buildings. It lost the AoE charm. By no means is this a bad game! But it falls short even with the great War Chiefs and Asian Dynasties expansion packs. I truly do recommend this as a RTS game because it is good, but it just lacks something to be really great...\\n------------------------------------------------------------------',\n",

The only thing I have to complain about is that it's pretty short, but you have some side missions as well to go through as well.\\nMultiplayer would also be nice. You can compare times, but that's about it. It would be nice to have like a race or to play it through with co-op. One play as Sonic and the other one plays as Tails, kinda like Sonic 4 ep 2. That would be awesome.\\nKeep in mind that if you have too many friends, you can't access the multiplayer part. It's a bug in the game that probably never will be fixed.

       "  'text': 'Okay this review is going to be based upon my experiences with this game.\\nI have this on PC, Xbox360 and PS Vita so it maybe slightly biased.\\nFound out this game was ported over from other consoles onto the PC. In doing so people have had problems with being able to play it. This was a USB Issue causing the game to crash for no apparent reason. The gameplay isn\\'t as appealing on the PC too.\\nWhereas if you play this game on the PS Vita you will enjoy this game alot more as it is designed to be played in short sessions.\\nThe main campaign is based upon the \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\" +1 Kingdom known as Jin.\\nIf you have played all the other Dynasty warrior games you know who wins.\\nThe things that make this game amazing though... The Voice Acting (It\\'s mediocre at best, but it is so repetitive it\\'s fun as hell).\\nThe mindless hack and slashing of thousands of enemies on a battlefield that respond to the situation. Still though the graphics is are less than desired.\\nUnlike Free Mode of the other games. This game has this \"ambition mode\" which is like a diamond in the rough.\\nShort sessions of killing a few enemies building up your town giving you access to more weapons, items and buffs.\\nIt gets extremely repetitive which is why this game is perfect on a handheld device (not on a PC).\\nOnce you complete your building of the palace the game opens up to where you are finally in charge of your officers on the battlefield and where the strategy of war comes in to play. This is also short sessions of 10 minutes and gets repetitive.\\nThe storymode is the only part of the game that cannot be played in short sessions as there are certain objectives that you have to follow. With this story you travel through the whole timeline of all the 4 factions. Major characters dying from Arrows, sickness or old age. Meaning you have to play other characters that you may be unconfortable with.\\nAttack styles aren\\'t tied to the characters, they are tied to their weapons which makes the game slightly easier to play with.\\nIn the end this game can not be recommended on PC. So either buy it on a handheld console or not at all.',\n",

You will do things that you regret, you will help the people who need it the most and you will survive, one way or another.\\nChoices matter here, you can murder people decimate communities or you can help fix the broken and worn out towns and ease the pain these poor souls must suffer from every day life. Someone upset you? bash their skull in with a hammer. Did someone take your teddy bear? blow their brains out. How about that ugly green mutant shooting hot lead at your face? MELT IT. You choose your skills, your weapon and your tactics. Be it melee weapons, guns, explosives, energy weapons or big♥♥♥♥♥versions of these, like say a minigun or laser equivalent. What about a gun that shoots nukes? The variety of traits and skills gives a different style each time you play. You can choose between light, medium and heavy armours that come with pros and cons along with stat changes.\\nFast travel is a option if you want to move quickly from discovered locations. This gives incentive to explore more areas and gives you the ability to travel more freely between the large landscape. If you're truly hardcore, don't use it and just walk everywhere you go. (Not recommended for new players)\\nThe trademark S.P.E.C.I.A.L (Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck) gives you the choice of adding points to each. Be a well rounded person, or dumb as a brick with super strength. Super smart and really slow and weak also work, but your big brain makes for a nice target, better add some points into luck to avoid getting headshot too often, or just sweet talk your way out of everything with a high charisma. If everything else fails, just take the bullets like they are your daily minerals.\\nI mean, if you don't like people you could always detonate an old war nuke..\\nExplore 200 year old vaults who have a secret and nasty history, with amazing and atmospheric story that makes you really think about the world you are in.\\nLike fast gameplay? Just do the main quest and forget about those perky side quests, or if you like a long and adventurous playthrough, explore the world and make a change to this hollow wasteland, for better or worse,\\nbecause war..\\nWar never changes.\\n(I bet you didn't see that coming)\\nPersonal Rating: 4.5/5\",\n",

The only thing it lacks from the other games is the use of weapons, style changes and a few of the historic chracters (not many though!). The story mode is a good addition and the cut-scenes try to make as much sense as they can with people ripping each other apart and then walking around fine in the next scene. The Krypt will keep you collecting coins to unlock new fatalitys and costumes. The moves aren't too complex to pull off in most cases, so it is about timing.
